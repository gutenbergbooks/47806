<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Like ruler, like people! Kings and emperors
are conspicuous specimens of the character of
their times. They are centers around which revolve
the prevailing tastes and passions of men.
They also influence and control the minds of their
subjects. If we would know the spirit of any period
of history, we need only to fix our gaze upon
the individuals in power at that time.</p>

<p>If we would ascertain, therefore, what sort of
a world it was into which Jesus Christ came; how
impossible it was that He should be its natural
and merely human product; against what a
dark background of selfishness and tyranny, immorality,
and vice His heavenly purity and self-sacrificing
love shone forth; what cynical materialism
and infidel philosophy, what coarse stolidity
and bitter malice He had to meet, and what
hindrances and persecutions His cause, in the persons
of His early followers, had to contend with,
we cannot do better than to study the lives of the
Roman emperors of the first century. This is the
reason for presenting here some sketches of the
careers of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,
and Nero, and for asking what relics can still be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
found of their times and of their work. To contemplate
some material object that they respectively
touched or planned or builded,&mdash;some hoary
ruin or crumbling fragment of temple, palace,
aqueduct, or sepulcher,&mdash;seems to bring us into
closer relation with them and to make more real
to us those great dramatic figures, which would
otherwise be but dim shadows of the past.</p>

<h2><span class="larger">UNDER CÆSARS’ SHADOW</span></h2>



<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subhead">CÆSAR AUGUSTUS</span></h2>


<p>We read in the second chapter of Luke’s Gospel
that “it came to pass in those days that there
went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus that all
the world should be enrolled.” The common version
of the New Testament says, “taxed.” But
the revised version, following more closely the
original Greek, says, “enrolled.” It was what we
call at the present day a registration, made in order
that none should escape the subsequent taxation.</p>

<p>The sacred narrative continues. “All went to
enroll themselves, every one to his own city.” Dr.
James Stalker remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This does not seem a very thrilling fact with which to begin
the Christmas story; it seems, even, prosaic. But when the stern
emperor’s edict went forth there was one young woman’s heart
which thrilled with the keenest dread. That was the heart of
Mary of Nazareth, called of God to be the mother of our Lord
Jesus Christ. It meant for her a long hard journey of eighty
miles, in the winter season, over the mountains and along the
roughest paths; it meant that she must suffer pain and privation
when she was frail in body and anxious in mind, and all because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
she could not escape going to Bethlehem to be enrolled. For
she and her husband Joseph were both direct descendants of
Israel’s best-beloved King, David, and must obey the law requiring
people to go back to the city from which their family had
first come and be enrolled and taxed there. So there was nothing
for her but to set out on the difficult journey, this sweet and
gentle maiden with her crown of supreme honor from God and
her burden of human anxiety and pain.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We can imagine one subject of the conversation
between her and Joseph on the way. Their
poverty and obscurity had hidden from public
notice the fact of their lineage, so direct from
David. But all the Jews were wont to preserve
with great care everything pertaining to their
genealogies, and it was especially the case with
those whose certainty of Davidic descent gave
them ground for hoping that the Messiah would
appear in their own line. We may believe that
Joseph took with him a copy of the official family
records, those that Matthew and Luke have preserved
for us, and that he pleased himself and
Mary along the toilsome way with the thought
that now their specially honorable descent would
have to be in some measure publicly recognized.
Cæsar Augustus himself had not so good a patent
of nobility as had they. Although the dark
shadow of that monarch was about to fall, by reason
of this decree for enrollment, across the very
beginning of the holy Child’s life, they were afterward
to realize that God’s providence had been
leading them and had caused human government
to become an involuntary agent for bringing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah
should be born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Now who was this Cæsar Augustus, that is assumed
to have had so great authority in the whole
world that at his bidding a registration had to be
taken in every part of it? He was no less than
the first sole master of Rome’s united empire,
one of the most conspicuous figures in the history
of the human race.</p>

<p>He had ascended the throne as the climax of a
series of very startling and tragic events. Julius
Cæsar,&mdash;that man so wonderful alike for military
genius, political sagacity, and literary skill, to
whom first the Roman Senate gave the imposing
title of <i>Imperator</i>, and who, if he had lived longer,
would probably have become all that this title
later grew to mean,&mdash;had been assassinated by a
group of conspirators at Rome in the year 44 before
the beginning of the Christian era. These
assassins claimed that they were doing a great
service to the state by delivering it from the
schemes of so ambitious a man; but none can deny
that jealousy was among the motives that impelled
them to commit the bloody deed, which
took place in the building in the Campus Martius
where the Senate that year convened, adjoining
the Theater of Pompey, and we are told that it
was at the feet of great Pompey’s statue that
Cæsar fell. Mark Antony, who had been his colleague
in the consulship and in the control of the
army, dramatically pronounced a funeral oration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
after Cæsar’s death from the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rostra</i> in the Forum
and then endeavored to make himself the successor
to Cæsar’s remarkable power and popularity.</p>

<p>But just then a new and strong competitor for
the military and political leadership appeared in
the person of a young man only nineteen years of
age, who is the subject of this sketch.</p>

<p>The name of this young man was at that time
Caius Octavius. He was the son of a Roman noble
of the same name and of his wife Atia,&mdash;who was
a niece of Julius Cæsar. They lived in a modest
home on the Palatine Hill. Caius Octavius was
also Julius Cæsar’s adopted son, and had been
chiefly educated under his provision and direction.
Moreover, Cæsar had designated him as his heir.</p>

<p>Caius Octavius proposed, therefore, now to become
the great dictator’s successor and avenger.
He assumed the longer name, Caius Julius Cæsar
Octavianus, and artfully secured,&mdash;first of all,&mdash;a
pledge from a large part of the army to support
and obey him. He found a great helper to his
ambitions in the most distinguished statesman of
that day, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Marcus
Tullius Cicero also welcomed Octavianus to Rome,
especially as he saw in this young aspirant a
rival to Mark Antony, whom Cicero intensely
hated. Indeed, that famous orator made exciting
speeches against Mark Antony, which greatly impaired
the influence of that commander.</p>

<p>Soon there was civil war. Octavian, as we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
now call him, was on one side, Mark Antony on
the other. In two battles the latter was defeated.
He barely escaped with his life; and so Octavian
now attained unto the superior authority, imposing
his will upon the government and securing
his proclamation as consul on the 22d of September,
forty-three years before Christ.</p>

<p>Having reached this stage of success, Octavian
began to plan the securing of the humiliation of
Brutus and Cassius, who had taken part in the
assassination of Julius Cæsar, and who, with their
comrades, called themselves “liberators,” in view
of their opposition to the concentration of power
in one man. To rid himself of annoyance by them,
Octavian needed all the help he could get. He
now, therefore, took a most amazing step and one
that betrayed his utter lack (at that time) of
moral principle. He changed his attitude toward
Mark Antony, conciliated his friendship, and actually
succeeded in forming an agreement with
him and with another ambitious competitor named
Lepidus, who had also been a prominent military
officer.</p>

<p>These three met together for three days on a
small island in the river Rhenus, and there agreed
to be a “triumvirate,” as they called it, for the
reconstitution of the commonwealth. This triumvirate,
which was to last for five years, was a most
high-handed conspiracy,&mdash;an insult to the dignity
of the Roman senate, a violation of many previous
professions and alliances, and a tyranny over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
rights of private citizens. Three hundred senators
and two thousand knights were arbitrarily
proscribed by the three usurpers of power. The
estates of these victims were plundered and many
of them were hunted to their deaths.</p>

<p>Each one of the triumvirate in this arrangement
sacrificed some one of his friends to please the
others. Thus, Octavian himself outraged all feelings
of honor and justice by allowing Marcus Tullius
Cicero, whose influence and advocacy had done
great things in his behalf, to be put to death.
This was a concession to Mark Antony,&mdash;or rather,
to Mark Antony’s wife Fulvia, who, it is said, had
cherished a bitter grudge against Cicero and now
triumphantly and dramatically thrust a needle
into the once eloquent tongue of the murdered
man, when his bleeding head was exposed to view
in the Forum. It was a horrible satisfaction of
cruel spite!</p>

<p>The combined forces of Octavian and Antony
soon met those of Brutus and Cassius in the
famous battle of Philippi in Macedonia, a city
far away from Rome, but made more memorable
later by the imprisonment and deliverance there of
the Christian missionaries Paul and Silas. As the
result of their humiliating defeat in that battle,
both Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. This
was in November, forty-two years before Christ.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">MARK ANTONY</div></div>

<p>Octavian returned to Italy to receive great honors
at Rome, and Mark Antony remained to be
the ostentatious ruler of the East. But the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
soon became infatuated with the notorious Cleopatra,
the queen of Egypt.</p>

<p>This woman played a large part in the case.
She had come to Mark Antony at Tarsus in Cilicia
to win him back from the wrath he had manifested
because she had not sent aid to him and Octavian
in their war against Brutus and Cassius. She
made her appearance before him in the most sensational
manner. In the summer of the year 41
B.&nbsp;C. she sailed up the river Cydnus in Asia Minor,
on which the city of Tarsus, the capital of
Cilicia, was situated. She was reclining upon a
gilded couch, under a stately canopy, upon the
deck of her galley, which was propelled by silver
oars and purple sails. She was personating the
goddess Venus, attended by the Graces and fanned
by Cupids. Pipes and lutes discoursed delightful
music and the air was perfumed with sweet odors.
The Apostle Paul, when he was a youth at Tarsus,
doubtless heard related this strange incident
that had taken place in his native city two generations
before his time. Mark Antony disgracefully
became Cleopatra’s complete slave and, carried
away by her insidious allurements, he yielded to
her capricious dictation in many atrocious acts of
oppression and cruelty.</p>

<p>There followed a period of disagreement and
bloody conflict between Octavian and Mark Antony.
It was connected with the appropriation
of private lands in Italy in order to reward Octavian’s
soldiers. The principal event in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
short civil war was the siege and capture of the
strong hill-town of Perusia (the modern Perugia),
where an old Roman gateway still bears the name
of the Arch of Augustus. I strayed out of that
gate, I remember, on my visit to Perugia and
looked up at the massive stones that frowned upon
the modern intruder. At the period of history of
which we are speaking Mark Antony was still in
the East, but his brother, Lucius Antonius, leading
an army in his behalf, occupied this famous
old hill-town. Octavian encamped around it, and
finally subdued it by siege and famine. It was
only saved from plunder by his soldiers, after his
capture of it, because it was set on fire by one of
its own citizens, although many of these were put
to death by the relentless victor.</p>

<p>In order to offset the injury to his prospects
caused by this defeat of his brother and to carry
out plots which he had been making with his allies
in Italy, Mark Antony crossed the Mediterranean
sea from the East, invaded Italy, and expected to
fight with Octavian. But these plans were frustrated,
because his soldiers and those of Octavian,
having fought together at Philippi, were not enthusiastic
for any such engagement with each
other. Negotiations followed. A new treaty was
made at Brundusium on the Adriatic coast. A
new division of the world was mapped out between
the two leaders, and the treaty was supposed to
be confirmed by a notable marriage that then
took place. This was between Mark Antony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
whose wife Fulvia had died, and Octavia, the sister
of Octavian. It was celebrated with great
pomp and joy. Fond hopes were entertained on
the occasion for an era of great peace and prosperity.
The poet Virgil is thought to have celebrated
this treaty of Brundusium in his famous
Fourth Eclogue. In glowing language,&mdash;reminding
us of the metaphors, if not of the spirit of Old
Testament Messianic predictions,&mdash;he speaks of
the birth of a predestined boy who should inaugurate
a reign of peace and blessedness on earth.
Exactly what boy he meant has been a subject of
much discussion. Some Christians of the Middle
Ages in their zeal claimed that he meant Jesus,
the Christ; and, as he refers to the Sibyl of Cumæ
as having foretold the happy period, her name, in
a later age, was curiously coupled in the old Latin
hymn “Dies Iræ” with that of the psalmist David
as giving her prophetic testimony:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
Teste David cum <span class="locked">Sibylla.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>  As David and the Sibyl say.</p></div>

<p>And so, Raphael and Michaelangelo both depicted
her as a prophetess in their Christian frescoes,
now to be seen in Rome. There were so
many Jews in Rome in Virgil’s time that he may
have read the prophecy of Isaiah and may have
caught something of his imagery; but it is not
probable that in his lines he expresses anything
more than an optimistic pagan’s general hope of a
glorious prince and a brighter day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>After the festivities of his marriage with Octavia,
Antony went back to his eastern domain,
with larger projects and many promises. But it
was not long before his profligate tastes again
manifested themselves. Not even the thought of
the noble character of his new wife, Octavia, could
restrain him. He went on from one great folly
to another. Although he came back once to southern
Italy and renewed with Octavian, at Tarentum,
the terms of “the triumvirate” for another
five years, it was all in vain. The wily Cleopatra
had again established her influence over him.
Finally, at her instigation, he placed himself at
the head of an oriental fleet and army and prepared
to meet the forces of Octavian. The decisive
battle between them was fought on the sea
at Actium, northwest of Greece, on the 2d of September,
B.&nbsp;C. 41. Antony was completely routed.
He narrowly made his escape on the galley of
Cleopatra, which opportunely appeared upon the
scene for his rescue. Almost immediately, in the
Egyptian city of Alexandria, both he and his infamous
enchantress perished tragically by suicide.</p>

<p>Thus Octavian became the sole master of practically
the whole world. Great success had been
achieved by his army over the Parthians in the
far East. Herod the Great, an Idumæan, was confirmed
about this time in his authority as King of
Judea.</p>

<p>Jerusalem had been captured by the Roman
general Pompey, in 63 B.&nbsp;C., and Judea had then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
become a part of the Roman province of Syria.
The Roman control of it had, however, been intermitted
until this time, when Herod entered it
and reigned triumphantly. Several other important
cities were also added to his domain. But it
was only as a subject of Rome that he had this
power. He was supported in his authority by the
army of Octavian, and was expected to obey every
beck and motion made to him by that emperor.
His administration of the affairs of that country
was vigorous and splendid, though it was characterized
by revolting cruelties. It is interesting
in this connection to remember how in early Old
Testament days Esau had sold his birthright to
Jacob, who henceforth supplanted him. There had
often, since that day, been enmity between the
children of Esau and the children of Jacob. Now,
for a time, this prince from Edom, a descendant
of Esau, sat upon the throne of Judea and reigned
over the posterity of Jacob, albeit he was overshadowed
and controlled, as we have seen, by Octavian&mdash;a
mightier potentate than himself.</p>

<p>It was when Herod was king at Jerusalem in
this way,&mdash;fawning upon the favor of Octavian
and fearing to incur that monarch’s displeasure,&mdash;that
Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>The Messiah, whom prophets had foretold and
whom the Jews were longing for, made His advent
in the humblest way. The Prince of Peace
came as a little child into a world of awful selfishness
and cruelty and conflict. Herod must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
died not long after that event. The sufferings
of his final illness are thought to have exasperated
his anxiety and cruelty and perhaps were among
the causes which led to his ordering the slaughter,
as described by Matthew, of the few young male
infants in the village of Bethlehem, the number
not being large enough to make the Jewish historian
Josephus record the incident alongside of
Herod’s other and more extensive iniquities.
While that ruler alienated the affections of the
Jews, yet he professed to be a Jew in religion and,
with scrupulous care, rebuilt the temple at Jerusalem,
which temple continued to stand during
the ministry of Jesus and of the Apostles. After
the death of Herod there was made among his
sons a distribution of the provinces of Palestine
by the emperor Octavian. It was because of fear
of one of these sons, Archelaus, who ruled in
Judea, that Joseph and Mary, returning with the
young child from Egypt, did not go to Bethlehem,
but turned aside and went to Nazareth in Galilee.
Sextus, the son of Pompey, who had commanded
a piratical fleet on the Mediterranean, intercepting
ships bound from Alexandria to Italy, was conquered
by the forces of Octavian and was slain.
The reputed son of Julius Cæsar and Cleopatra,
Cæsarion by name, was also put to death.</p>

<p>Octavian was now made <i>Imperator</i>, and Censor
of the Empire for life. This does not mean that
all of the forms of a republic were at once destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
but that the government was administered
in the spirit of an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>Octavian retained the family name of Cæsar,
which was also assumed by his successors, as an
official designation, even when they belonged to
other lines of descent; just as are the modern
titles of “Kaiser” in Germany and “Czar” in
Russia, which are, indeed, derived from the Roman
name.</p>

<p>Octavian was a man of great ambition and had
overcome the violence and perfidy of others by
often using their own methods. He was reserved
in speech and bearing, and was somewhat simple
in his manner of living. He had a large degree
of coolness and self-control. He was shrewd, politic,
and far-seeing in adapting means to his ends.
He gathered all the lines of power into his hands
almost before the people realized that he was
doing it. We are told that he had under his direct
management “the disposal of revenues, the movements
of the army, the execution of the laws, the
administration of internal reforms and the adjustment
of foreign relations.” First the senators
then the plebians yielded to him many of their
long-cherished rights. Under his management the
famed Republic became an empire; and he was
the emperor indeed. His dominions extended
from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the islands
of Britain to the sands of Africa.</p>

<div id="ip_24" class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="437" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">CICERO</div></div>

<p>While Rome had been conquering the world she
had been losing her liberties at home. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
had really been left of liberty except its name.
But it must be admitted that, intense and stern
as Octavian was in grasping after power, he
showed wise moderation in its exercise. He reconciled
the people to the loss of their freedom by
securing to them greater material prosperity and
many exciting amusements. He expended great
sums on public roads and splendid buildings,
sewers, reservoirs, bridges, quays, parks, gardens,
and public offices in great profusion. Many of
his associates followed his example and erected
costly edifices, ornamented with columns and statues
in marble and bronze. It was his boast that
he had found Rome built of brick and would leave
it made of marble. He patronized the arts and
the sciences. He gathered around him men of
brilliant talents,&mdash;statesmen, orators, philosophers,
historians, painters, sculptors and poets.
Vipsanius Agrippa, his prime minister, Mæcenas,
Cicero, Livy, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, besides
many lesser lights, distinguished his reign and
adorned his court. What the age of Pericles was
to Greece and that of Elizabeth was to England
the reign of this man was to the Roman empire.
In religion he was not much more than a stoic
philosopher, but he recognized the value of a religious
faith among the people and so was glad
to encourage them in the maintenance of pagan
altars and temples, many of which he built. It is
said that in the year 28 B.&nbsp;C. not less than eighty-two
temples were rebuilt in Rome itself. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
erected and restored the temple of Apollo upon
the Palatine, and near it he established a splendid
library. The Senate decreed that he should have
the then unique title of <span class="smcap">Augustus,&mdash;<span class="smaller">THE AUGUST
ONE</span></span>. It was a title that Octavian’s successors
tried to retain, but it has become his own special
and superb designation in the pages of history, so
that we now often forget that it was really only
an adjective and not his proper name. The eighth
month in the year was called August, in his honor,
just as the seventh month had been called July,
in honor of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>Augustus, as we must now call him, was the
Cæsar for whom was named the city of Cæsarea,
which Herod the Great built on the seacoast of
Palestine, to be the political capital of that country,
and which the book of the Acts has led us to
associate later with the centurion Cornelius, in
whose house the Apostle Peter preached. It was
the home city of the Evangelist Philip and his
four daughters (Acts xxi:8, 9) and the scene of
Paul’s great speeches before the Roman governors,
Felix and his wife Drusilla, Festus, and
King Agrippa II, and his sister, Bernice. (Acts
xxiv:24; xxv:13.) Herod, as another act of obsequious
flattery, also built a marble temple to Augustus
at Paneas, at one of the sources of the
Jordan, near the base of Mount Hermon, at the
place that his son Herod Philip II, the tetrarch,
afterward rebuilt and called,&mdash;from the emperor
and himself,&mdash;Cæsarea Philippi, whither Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Christ once came during his ministry, the most
northern point he ever visited, and held one of
the most significant conversations with his disciples.</p>

<p>My memory recalls with great pleasure the day
when a little group of tourists in Palestine (one of
which I had the privilege of being), there pitched
after a weary day’s journey their white tents,
amid desolation and fragmentary ruins, and gazed
upon the spring waters rushing, fresh and cold,
from the venerated cave under the hill. Around
this cave some architectural niches for statues are
cut into the natural rock, but the statues have
long since disappeared. Its original name of
Paneas, derived from the rustic god Pan, is now
corrupted into Baneas. A massive castle of the
crusaders frowns down from a great height, but
in the valley only wrecks of man’s ambitious
structures make a pathetic contrast with the beauties
of nature. It was in that region, probably,
on one of the foothills of Mount Hermon, that the
Transfiguration took place.</p>

<p>If we turn to consider the family life of the Emperor
Augustus, we learn that after one or two
betrothals in his early youth, which engagements
were not followed up, he married a lady of high
rank named Scribonia, by whom he had one child,
a daughter, named Julia. Afterward, when he
was known as Octavian, and was one of the triumvirs,
he either fell desperately in love with another
man’s wife or he was swayed by his intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
ambition at the time to ally himself with the aristocratic
families of Rome. At any rate, he divorced
Scribonia and carried off as his wife Livia
Drusilla, who was the wife of a prominent citizen,
Tiberius Claudius Nero. By him Livia had one
son, who afterward became the Emperor Tiberius.
She was soon to be the mother of another, the
celebrated general Drusus. So far was Tiberius
Claudius Nero from resisting her divorce from
him to marry Augustus, that, it is said, he gave
her a dowry and was present at the wedding.
Some historians, indeed, think that it was in accordance
with his own plans. He was old and
infirm. His wife was only nineteen and he may
have been glad to provide for her marriage, possibly,
with the young and rising triumvir, and
thus conciliate him to a better treatment of the
aristocratic party.</p>

<p>However this may have been, it illustrates the
loose Roman views of marriage in that day. It
put Livia in a strange and trying position. Her
own father had been among those aristocrats
whom the triumvirs had proscribed and hunted.
He had fought with Brutus and Cassius and had
died by his own hand after being defeated with
them by the army of Augustus at the battle of
Philippi. Two years before this marriage Livia
had fled from Italy with her husband, Tiberius
Claudius Nero, to escape the vengeance of Octavian.
Now she leaves the former to become the
wife of the latter. She had to turn away for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
time from her own son Tiberius and, three months
later, when her child Drusus was born in the home
of Augustus, this second son was sent to the house
of his father, Tiberius Claudius Nero.</p>

<p>Serene and practical, Livia seems to have accepted
the fate assigned her and endured all the
sacrifices it involved. A few years later, however,
when Tiberius Claudius Nero died, he appointed
Octavian,&mdash;who had then become the Emperor
Augustus,&mdash;the guardian of his sons, and Livia
received them back and cared for them with a
mother’s devoted solicitude. She seems truly to
have won the admiration if not the affection of
Augustus. He was proud of her ability, her faithfulness,
her household thrift, her wise counsel in
the affairs of state. They lived simply in their
house upon the Palatine. It was devoid either
of magnificent display or precious objects of art.
The furniture was exhibited in the second century
of our era and was wondered at for its plainness.
She superintended personally the treatment
of the wool, its distribution among the
slaves, and its weaving for family use. Augustus
never wore any togas that were otherwise made.
Their several villas at Lanuvium, Palestrina, and
Tivoli were all unpretentious. They sometimes
entertained prominent people at dinner, but only
on extraordinary occasions were there six courses
served,&mdash;usually there being but three.</p>

<p>On one public occasion Augustus made a long
speech in which he cited Livia as a model for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the ladies of Rome. He set forth minutely the
details of her household management,&mdash;what she
did, how she dressed, at what expense, how she
amused herself, and what amusements she deemed
suitable for a person of her position. The Romans
regarded her as the perfect type of an aristocratic
lady. She seems to have been dignified
and handsome in person, and thoughtful in spirit.
Her two sons,&mdash;Tiberius and Drusus, the stepsons
of Augustus,&mdash;were also very popular. Notwithstanding
the outrageous wrong of her compelled
divorce from her former husband, many
annoyances from her stepdaughter Julia, and the
temptations of a royal court, she maintained a
strong and self-controlled character, and, during
a married life of fifty years, kept to the last the
affection of her husband. It is reported that he
said to her at last, as he lay upon his death-bed:</p>

<p>“Preserve the memory of a husband who has
loved you very tenderly.”</p>

<p>When asked at one time how she contrived to
retain his affection, Dion Cassius tells us that she
significantly replied:</p>

<p>“My secret is very simple: I have made it the
study of my life to please him, and I have never
manifested any indiscreet curiosity with regard to
his public or private affairs.”</p>

<p>In all the life of the imperial court, not only
in the reign of Augustus but, as we shall see, in
that of her son Tiberius, the able and tactful management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of this commanding lady was an important
factor.</p>

<p>But, aside from his regard for Livia and in
spite of all his wealth and power and the flattery
of his subjects, Augustus was far from happy.
He had been bereaved by death of many of those
whom he esteemed and loved, such as Drusus,
Caius and Lucius Cæsar. He was often the victim
of mortification, sorrow and moroseness. His
daughter, Julia, disgraced him by her immoral
conduct. There was always incompatibility between
her and Livia. His grandsons died soon
after. He did not take much delight in the
thought of his stepson, Tiberius, as his successor,
and the marriage of Julia to Tiberius did not improve
the situation. But the jealousies and intrigues
of his court made for him constant trouble.</p>

<p>In his last days he made a generous will, distributing
thereby gifts to many of those who had
served him, including huge donations to the soldiers,
to the public treasury, and to the populace.
He also compiled a list of achievements by which
the empire had been benefited under his reign and
for which he had received public honors. This
memorial he intended to be cast in bronze for the
doors of the great mausoleum that he had built
in Rome for his burial place. We are indebted
for its preservation, however, to the Galatians,
who, inhabiting a province in the heart of Asia
Minor, had erected during the life of Augustus a
temple in his honor at their city of Ancyra, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
modern Angora. They obtained a copy of the
memorial and inscribed it upon the walls of the
vestibule of this temple; and there, though greatly
marred and broken, it can be read even at the
present day,&mdash;a fine record of the great monarch’s
deeds.</p>

<p>It was the propensity of Augustus to use the
vast riches at his disposal for the benefit of the
people. Sometimes he distributed freely corn,
wine, and oil and sometimes allowances in money.
He asserted that he spent in gifts what was equivalent
to the sum of twenty-six millions of dollars
(American money). To these many other donations
must be added; so that it has been reckoned
that his expenditure for the benefit of the people
amounted to ninety-one millions of dollars. Says
Lanciani:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Were we not in the presence of official statistics and of state
documents, we should hardly feel inclined to believe these enormous
statements.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Augustus died at Nola in Campania, Italy, August
19, A.&nbsp;D. 14, when he was nearly seventy-six
years of age. Before he died he had a long conversation
with his stepson Tiberius. On the day
of his death, when some friends entered his room,
he said to them:</p>

<p>“Do you think that I have acted my part well
on the stage of life? If you are satisfied, give
me your applause!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after, he expired in the arms of his wife
Livia.</p>

<p>“His body,” it is said, “was transported from
village to village, from city to city, along the Appian
Way by the members of each municipal council
in turn. To avoid the heat, the procession
marched only at night. At the foot of the Alban
Hills the whole Roman knighthood had come out
to meet the bearers. Thence, over the last ten
miles of the road, the progress was like a triumphal
one, till the bier was placed in the vestibule
of the Palace on the Palatine Hill. Afterwards
the body was carried to the Forum, to the space
in front of the Temple of Julius Cæsar, where
from the rostra a panegyric was read by Tiberius.
Another oration was delivered at the opposite
end of the Forum by Drusus, the adopted
son of Tiberius. Thence the senators, the high
priests, the knights, the army and a large part of
the leading citizens continued the march by the
Via Flaminia to the Ustrinum, or enclosure for
cremation. Officers and men threw on the pyre
the decorations which Augustus had awarded
them for bravery, and the torch was applied by
the captains of the legions which he had often
led to victory.”</p>

<p>Five days afterward Livia and the chief men of
the Equestrian order gathered up his ashes and
bore them to the Mausoleum.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of Augustus he had been
venerated as a god in the provinces; now he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
actually worshiped in Rome itself. Adoration
was paid to him in many private homes. He
also had a cult, sanctuaries, and a priesthood assigned
to him. Livia became the special priestess
of the new divinity.</p>

<p>There have come down to us, in a remarkable
state of preservation, many statues, medallions,
busts, and coins, which have kept for us his face,
his form, and his bearing. In the Hall of Busts
in the Vatican Museum we have that beautiful
head which was found at Ostia, at the mouth of
the Tiber, in <span class="locked">1808.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> It is admired by all, and is
always spoken of as “the Young Augustus.” It
represents the future emperor with a prominent
nose, an intellectual forehead, wavy hair, a
rounded chin, and an expression both thoughtful
and amiable. What was he thinking of when the
sculptor caught his expression? Had he premonitions
of the successes and responsibilities before
him? Our knowledge of his subsequent career
illuminates for us his marble features. They
have an attractive ideality, which we can hardly
associate with one who afterward became such
a stern warrior; and we are drawn to him for the
moment with tender sympathy and exalted hopes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Without stopping to describe other figures of
him, it is interesting to contrast this one with that
splendid full-length marble statue, also in the Vatican,
which was not discovered until 1863. It was
found buried in the ruins of the villa of his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Livia, seven miles from Rome. This also bears
every mark of being a portrait from life. How
impressive that it has been hidden in the earth
for so many centuries, during which many kingdoms
have risen and fallen; and now it has been
brought forth, almost like a resurrection, and we
can stand, as it were, face to face with him! It
shows him to us in all his majesty, late in his career,
when he had become the grand master of the
world. He stands in a calm and commanding attitude,
bearing his weight on his right foot, wearing
his military breastplate, with drapery carefully
arranged around his hips and thrown over
his left arm. His left hand carries a scepter,
while his right is extended as if he were deliberately
addressing his army. The countenance
bears the stamp of much experience and of deep
seriousness, if not of anxiety. He seems to be
oppressed by the weight of empire. On his breastplate
or cuirass, which appears to be copied from
the metallic original worn by him, are seen Greek
designs, which have been compared with cameos
for the beauty and delicacy of their detail. The
central group of these embossed figures represents
a Roman general receiving some military standards
from a conquered foe. It is very probably
commemorative of the victory won by the Roman
army over the Parthians about 17 B.&nbsp;C., when Augustus
had deputed his stepson Tiberius to carry
on the campaign and afterward to secure in a
formal manner from Phraates, the king of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Parthians, those bronze eagles that the Parthians
had taken away from the Roman general Crassus
and his soldiers more than thirty years before.
That defeat had been a bitter recollection to the
Romans ever since it occurred, and the restoration
of the standards was a matter of corresponding
rejoicing. They were sent to Rome, where they
were placed by Augustus in the Temple of Mars
Ultor. It seems probable that this statue was
carved soon after that time, about 17 B.&nbsp;C. On
the two sides of the representation, bent over in
sorrow, sit two symbolical figures, the probable
genii of two conquered nations. Near the neck
of the cuirass appears the god Cælus emerging
from the clouds, holding a scarf blown by the wind
and arching above his head, while before him
Apollo riding in his chariot reminds us of the
figures of Guido’s famous fresco of Aurora on the
ceiling of the Rospigliosi Casino in <span class="locked">Rome.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> No
figure could better personify the conscious gravity
of universal lordship than does this stately
statue of Augustus. When first discovered some
portions of it bore traces of coloring. A little
cherub riding upon a dolphin is placed against the
right foot, supporting the work and, by contrast,
setting forth its dignity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>  It seems at first thought that Guido must have gotten the
suggestion for his group from these figures on the cuirass of Augustus.
But how could he? During Guido’s life this statue was unknown and lay
buried in the ground.</p></div>

<p>I have spoken of the great buildings erected in
the time of Augustus. Notwithstanding the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that the medieval Romans made the ancient ruins
of their city such a quarry for building material
out of which to construct their palaces, some evidences
of this emperor’s noble edifices still exist.
The Regia, or Royal House (of which now only
a few traces are found), in the Forum, had been
the residence of the rulers of the early Roman
kingdom and afterward of the leaders of the Republic;
but, as Augustus had been born upon the
Palatine and as that historic hill afforded a much
more spacious and commanding site, the people,&mdash;when
they made Augustus Imperator twenty-eight
years before Christ,&mdash;there erected for him a
splendid palace. Foundations of this building,
which are probably not yet fully excavated, are
still to be seen.</p>

<p>The beautiful mosaic pavements and frescoed
walls of some of the chambers of the house of
Livia his wife can also be visited on the Palatine
Hill. This is the only building of its kind in the
midst of the ruined palaces of the emperors.
Livia had received it from her first husband, the
father of Tiberius, and to it she retired after the
death of her second husband, Augustus. A flight
of six steps descends to the marble floor, which
is laid out in patterns. From this three chambers
can be entered. The paintings upon the plastered
walls of the dining-room and sitting-room are
very artistic in design and coloring. They are
among the most ancient paintings in existence.
They represent mythological scenes and characters,&mdash;Mercury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Polyphemus, and Galatea, with
fruits, flowers, masks, and sacrificial offerings.
Some of the tints are still bright, and suggest a
homelike warmth. The triclinium or dining-room
is recognizable by an inscription.</p>

<div id="ip_37" class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;"><img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">ALTAR OF PEACE</div></div>

<p>Near the Tiber we have the five columns and
other parts of the Portico of Octavia, which was
erected by Augustus and dedicated to his sister
Octavia. In the days of the republic, porticoes or
open colonnaded buildings for public resorts had
been almost a rarity; but Augustus introduced
a fashion and taste for them. In less than twenty
years the Campus Martius (now covered by modern
Rome) is said to have been full of them. They
added much to the architectural splendor of the
city. The Portico of Octavia is said to have had
three hundred columns, enclosing a court with
temples to Jupiter and Juno.</p>

<p>The massive architecture of what is left of the
Theatre of Marcellus, in the same region, reminds
us of Octavia’s son, to whose memory Augustus
dedicated it. Twelve arches of the outer circular
wall are now used as blacksmiths’ and other shops.
The lower story is partly sunk in the earth. Its
columns are much battered. Its arches and capitals
are also badly bruised. In the eleventh century
it was used as a fortress. Afterward a palace
was built on the mound of rubbish within it.
The historian Niebuhr, when he was the Russian
ambassador, occupied it as his home.</p>

<p>The temple of Mars Ultor (Avenger) is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of the buildings of Augustus. Before the battle
of Philippi, which was such an important turning-point
in his career, he made a vow that should he
be victorious he would build a temple to Mars the
Avenger, because the assassination of his foster-father
Julius Cæsar would be avenged by such a
victory over Brutus and Cassius on that occasion.
With the fulfillment of this vow he combined the
construction of a new Forum, or public exchange,
for Rome.</p>

<p>These noble edifices were sometimes in later
centuries degraded to very commonplace uses.
The Portico of Octavia, for example, was for
many generations and until lately used as a fish
market. The buildings mentioned were all large
and costly constructions. As Augustus deposited
in the Temple of Mars Ultor the rescued standards
of Crassus, so for several generations victorious
generals stored away their insignia in the
same place. One of its features was a gallery of
statues of the military heroes whose victories
had enlarged the territory and glory of the empire.
The costly pavement of the Forum now lies
twenty feet below the present level of the ground.
It requires an effort of the imagination to reconstruct
the ancient scene from the old, soiled fragments.
Yet it can be done by the student of all
the surroundings; and future excavations will reveal
much more. For a people among whom the
army and war were so important, the Temple of
Mars was a center of the greatest interest. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
beauty is described as of the highest sort. Augustus
says in his will that the Roman citizens who
fought under his orders numbered five hundred
thousand. At the time of his death one hundred
and sixty thousand Roman citizens were still serving
under the flag. The number of men-of-war
captured, burnt or sunk is stated at six hundred.</p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="600" height="438" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE CRYPTOPORTICUS</div></div>

<p>But Augustus honored peace no less than war.
He thrice took the census of Rome, showing an
increase of the inhabitants from four millions
sixty-three thousand to nearly five millions. In
the inscriptions, already referred to as existing
in the ruins of the temple of Angora in Asia Minor,
he tells us that in the year 13 B.&nbsp;C. the Senate
ordered an altar to be built in the Campus
Martius to the divinity Pax Augusta (Augustan
Peace), upon which magistrates, priests, and vestal
virgins might offer a yearly sacrifice. In after
ages this altar became covered with rubbish and
above the rubbish was accumulated in time a cemetery
belonging to the adjoining church of San
Lorenzo in Lucina. But this cemetery, it is said,
was ten feet below the present level of the city.
In the latter part of the thirteenth century, over it
and over the altar of Peace beneath it Cardinal
Evesham built a palace, which has since passed
through various hands. In the early part of the
sixteenth century five carved panels of remarkable
beauty were brought to light from this
ground. Other pieces were found, but were carried
to various places,&mdash;even to Paris, Vienna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and England. It was not until about the beginning
of the present century that it was proved
that they belonged to the famous Augustan Altar
of Peace. Excavations have since been made upon
the original site, sixteen feet below the street
level.</p>

<p>Vaulted passages have been constructed, so that
it is possible to pass along two sides of the altar’s
foundation; and at the end of one of these passages,
practically embedded in earth and rubbish,
may be seen to-day a most beautifully carved
panel showing a sacrificial procession. The altar
stood upon a platform three and one-quarter feet
high and measuring nineteen and a half by eleven
and one-half feet. It was approached by steps on
four sides. All this was placed in the midst of a
sacred area thirty-eight feet by thirty-five feet,
enclosed by marble walls elaborately carved in
relief on both sides. Among the representations
is a procession moving toward a sacrificial scene.
The figures are characterized by great dignity and
their drapery is arranged to produce a graceful
effect. Augustus himself and many of the persons
high in rank and power during his reign are
grouped as if in conversation. It is evident that
the whole structure was a most highly wrought
and artistic composition, a fitting monument to
him whose boast it was that he had secured unity
and peace throughout his empire and had caused
the gates of Janus, the god of war, to be closed
for a long time. Professor James C. Egbert, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Columbia University, in his description of this
altar in the “Records of the Past” for 1906, to
which I am indebted, thus described two of the
panels, which are now in the Uffizzi Gallery at
Florence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In one of these there are two family groups both marked by the
presence of husband and wife. The tall young man on the left
is Drusus, who died B.&nbsp;C. 9, greatly mourned by the emperor and
the people. He wears a military cloak, as he has left his command
in Rhætia to attend the dedication of the altar. His wife,
the beautiful Antonia, stands immediately before him and their
conversation is interrupted by the warning gesture of the figure
between, who calls for silence lest they mar the sanctity of the
occasion. The child at their feet is either Germanicus or the
later emperor, Claudius. The group to the right may be Tiberius
and his wife Julia, whom he, much to his disgust, was compelled
to marry after the death of her former husband, Vipsanius Agrippa.
The wife may be the sister of Antonia in the first group. Then
the husband would be Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, the grandfather
of Nero. Vipsanius Agrippa played a very important part
in bringing about the reign of peace and we should expect to
find him among the members of the imperial group. The central
figure in another panel has been recognized as Agrippa because
of the distinction suggested by the repose of the countenance.
Some see here a sadness of expression natural to one who has
suffered much. He is preceded by a young man who bears on his
shoulder the official ax, for Agrippa appears here as a high-priest.
The boy grasping his toga is Lucius Cæsar, his son, and
the beautiful woman on his left may be Julia, his wife, or
Vipsania Agrippina, his daughter.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this description we may add that such graceful
and charming sculptures, with their portraits
of leading personages, could not have been unveiled
to the Roman public without awakening
great admiration.</p>

<p>To the period of Augustus also belongs the
foundation, at least, of the Pantheon. His prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
minister and son-in-law, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa,
erected a temple, twenty-seven years before
Christ, at the north end of the warm baths, which
he had established here in the Campus Martius.
It was dedicated to several gods. It has often
been repaired and probably altered and enlarged
by restorations. The emperors Hadrian, Septimius
Severus, and Caracalla all contributed to its
preservation and development. In antiquity the
portico was reached by five steps, which are now
covered by the rising of the ground. Since A.&nbsp;D.
609 it has been consecrated as a Christian church.
Notwithstanding this, in A.&nbsp;D. 663 Constans II,
emperor at Constantinople, carried away to his
city the gilt-bronze tiles of the roof.</p>

<p>Throughout the middle ages this temple was
prized as the palladium and emblem of Rome.
The main part of the building is circular in form,&mdash;the
height and diameter of which are said to
be equal, each being one hundred and forty-two
feet,&mdash;and is composed of that concrete that the
ancient Romans knew how to make so lasting. It
is lighted by an uncovered aperture, thirty feet in
diameter, in the center of the dome, rimmed by an
elegant ancient cornice of bronze. The rich columns
of different kinds of marble and the other
decorations of the interior are most imposing, and
correspond well with the stately Corinthian portico
which forms the front of the edifice and under
which once stood colossal bronze statues of
Augustus and Agrippa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>The five front steps by which it was entered in
ancient times, are now covered by the raising of
the ground all around the building. The entrance
is still closed by the ancient massive, bronze doors.
In 1632 Pope Urban VIII, one of the Barberini
family, took away the bronze columns and ceiling
of the portico to make out of them the elaborate
pillars which support the canopy of the high altar
in St. Peter’s, and also cannon for the Castle of St.
Angelo. This occasioned the circulation of a
popular epigram of Pasquin. “What the Barbarians
did not do the Barberini did.”</p>

<p>The Pantheon is the noblest and best preserved
building of ancient Rome,&mdash;the only one, indeed,
having both its walls and vaulting intact, and it
is still closed by its ancient heavy bronze doors.
Lord Byron’s lines concerning it are well worth
quoting because of the conciseness of his description.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is not strange that it was deemed the most
fitting place for the burial of the great artist,
Raphael, and for that of the King of United Italy,
Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>Of the former event the poet Rogers says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Raphael went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heavenly face the mirror of his mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">’Twas on an April day, when Nature smiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Rome was there.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Victor Emmanuel’s tomb is always covered with
wreaths, tributes by the living to his honor.</p>

<p>The remnants of the great mausoleum of Augustus,&mdash;in
which not only he but many of his successors
were interred,&mdash;are not now sought out by
many except students of antiquities. The last of
the emperors buried here was Nerva. Near the
river Tiber, on what was then the Campus Martius
or field of Mars, on a great platform of stone,
now beneath the ground, rose the huge circular
building of two stories, in which were the chambers
for the dead. Augustus was buried in the
central chamber, which was covered with a dome.
From this radiated fourteen smaller ones, most
of which can now be traced, though in a ruined
condition. Above these was a pyramidal mound
of earth in terraces planted with cypress trees and
surmounted with a large statue of the emperor
himself. The whole was surrounded by an attractive
park.</p>

<p>For centuries the monument was well known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the people. War, earthquake and neglect have
now made its ruins one of the least conspicuous
sights in Rome, but some will ever find in them a
deep pathetic interest. After some searching I
found the entrance to them not far from the Via
Di Ripetta. Upon my application, the custodian,
who was an old woman, admitted me from a sort
of court, where I could look up at a part of the
circular exterior and where there was a fountain
at the side. An inscription tablet let into the wall
informs the visitor (in Latin) that here is the
western wall of the mausoleum of Augustus disclosed
by the removal of buildings. What seemed
to be electric wires, stretched down along the side
of the building, suggested a curious connection
between the beginning of the first century and the
beginning of the twentieth. Within the structure
I paced the corridors, gazed at the arched ceiling,
and could see out through the large windows into
the central space. In the twelfth century the
central dome was thrown down by an earthquake.
Afterward the center was used as an open-air
arena and was occupied by a popular circus until
a few years ago. At the time of my visit it was
a storehouse for the great plaster models for the
sculptures to be placed on the new monument that
was building to the memory of King Victor Emmanuel.
The Egyptian obelisks, forty-five feet
high, which stood before the entrance in the first
century, now are to be found, one of them in front
of the Quirinal Palace,&mdash;which is the royal residence,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the other one in the square by the
great church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Thus,
long ago rifled of its contents, the burial-place of
the celebrated master of the ancient world has
stood for centuries, broken and neglected.</p>

<p>Since the time I was there, however, a new
interest in it has awakened and a change has been
made. The circular interior has been cleared
out, and furnished with platform and seats. It
has become a place again of public entertainment
and is known as The Augustean. Orchestral
concerts of a high order are there performed. In
the interlude of the music the visitor can ponder
upon the march of the nineteen centuries which
have passed away since the walls around him were
erected.</p>

<p>Augustus had been upon the throne about
twenty-four years when Jesus was born. That holy
Child had come to share our lot and to reveal
clearly to men the knowledge of the Heavenly Father
at a time when all its political kingdoms had
thus become consolidated by force or treaty under
one name of power, when better conditions and
roads were preparing for the diffusion of Christianity,
and when men were beginning to dream
that there might be such a thing as a common loyalty
to one great sovereign. Was it too difficult
a step as yet for their minds to take from the
contemplation of a universal dominion to the doctrine
of a universal brotherhood? The quiet and
unobserved beginning of our Lord’s spiritual and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
gracious mission was thus put in striking contrast
with the outward magnificence of the world’s great
conqueror, and the purely spiritual methods of the
Gospel with the noisy forces of a ponderous army.</p>

<p>When Augustus died Jesus was about eighteen
years old. In a time of such infrequent communication
between distant places a quiet town in
Galilee, like Nazareth, would have slight relations
with any higher authority than Herod. Yet Jesus
must have often seen in his boyhood Roman military
standards and groups of soldiers. He must
have gazed with eager interest and curiosity upon
their strong armor and shining weapons and
watched with wonder their well-ordered movements.
Roman coins must have been familiar
objects to him, with their medal and superscriptions
of the reigning monarch. He must have
often discussed with his companions the various
pieces of news that came from time to time from
the great metropolis of the Empire. The death
of the emperor in Italy, and the succession of
Tiberius to the throne, as these were announced
by couriers throughout the realm, must have
stirred in him many serious reflections and exalted
aspirations, many thrilling purposes of
righteous zeal and tender love for men. Along
with his gradual increase of knowledge as to the
wide extent of Cæsar’s magnificent empire, there
developed in his mind the sublime conception of
the Kingdom of God, his prophetic vision of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
blessed sway, and his consciousness that he himself
was to be the Messianic King.</p>

<p>Never will the thoughtful part of the world
finish the study of that wonderful life, the childhood
and the youth of which were among the
things that came to pass in the days of Cæsar
Augustus.</p>

<span class="subhead">TIBERIUS: THE CÆSAR OF CHRIST’S MINISTRY</span></h2>

<div id="ip_49" class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;"><img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="464" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">TIBERIUS</div></div>


<p>After Cæsar Augustus came Tiberius Cæsar.
His father’s name was Tiberius Claudius Nero.
His mother was the famous Livia Drusilla. She
was afterward taken away from her husband to
become the wife of the Emperor Augustus, with
whom, as we have already shown, she shared the
honors and power of his distinguished career.
Tiberius and his full brother Drusus,&mdash;younger
than himself,&mdash;became, therefore, the stepsons of
Augustus.</p>

<p>While still a youth Tiberius appeared in honor
upon several occasions, and once he made a plea
before the emperor in behalf of the King Archelaus
and the Thessalians. Later he became also
the son-in-law of Augustus, by his marriage to
Julia, his stepsister. To accomplish this, and
thus obey the command of Augustus, Tiberius
separated from his first wife, Vipsania, with
whom always, however, his heart remained. Suetonius
tells us that one day afterward, when he
accidentally met her, his eyes filled with tears and
followed her as long as she was in sight. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
pathetic incident does much to increase our interest
in him.</p>

<p>His brother Drusus, to whom he was much attached,
died in the year 9 B.&nbsp;C. when he was in
military service on the banks of the Rhine. Bringing
back his body to Rome, Tiberius walked on
foot before the funeral train all the long journey.
Augustus gave to him also the honorable mission
of going to receive from the Parthians the military
standards that Crassus had lost in war with
that people, but which they were now willing to
restore.</p>

<p>Tiberius performed with energy every duty that
Augustus assigned to him. He rapidly, therefore,
received military promotion. For thirty years he
was a prominent and skillful general and acquired
much experience in public affairs. He was strict
in military discipline and a good administrative
officer. He was sent across the Rhine nine times
on important missions. Many believed him to
possess those stern, Roman qualities that would
fit him for the highest position. His temper, however,
was somewhat surly and, like many of his
contemporaries, he seems to have had little reluctance
to shed blood.</p>

<p>He was admitted to an important and special
share of the government two years before the
death of Augustus. He was thirty-five years old
when he came to the throne. His accession was
quietly brought about by the careful management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of his mother, Livia, by the support of the army,
and by the acquiescence of the people.</p>

<p>The inheritor of a vast empire from his predecessor,
Tiberius had at the outset much to do to
keep its various parts in subordination. For
some time he avoided foolish extravagance and
insisted upon order and efficiency in the various
departments. He defeated the plans of the
enemies who had plotted against him, and showed
much decision and firmness. He did not allow
himself in the first years of his reign to come into
conflict with the senators, and conciliated them in
various ways. He was very obsequious, at the
same time, to the wishes of his ambitious mother,
Livia, who had always been watchful of his interests,
and who was a great helper to his plans.
The first nine years of his reign he was a conservative
ruler. If he had died within that period
he might have been rated by posterity as an industrious
and patriotic monarch.</p>

<p>But even during that time he was unlike Augustus,
in that he had none of those striking
qualities that appeal to the sentiment and imagination
of the people. He had no personal magnetism.
He led in no great enterprises. He cared
neither to provide nor to attend exciting gladiatorial
shows. On the other hand, he was often
gloomy and irritable, cynical in judgment, and
fearful of the malice of his enemies. This tendency
was afterward increased by disappointments
in his domestic life. His marriage with Julia, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
daughter of Augustus, owing to her bad character,
proved to be unfortunate and unhappy. He
turned against her, and fifteen years of later experience
in life could not soften his attitude
toward her.</p>

<p>The victories, triumphs, and death of his
nephew, Germanicus, the son of his brother
Drusus, occurred during his reign. Germanicus
was a great soldier, a man of interesting character,
and a sort of popular idol. While the
people were giving themselves up to mourning
over his death, Tiberius told them that both they
and he should find the best consolation in attending
to their regular duties. This seemed to them
to be a very cold treatment of the occasion and
confirmed their suspicions that the emperor had
been jealous of Germanicus. It lessened his hold
upon the affections of the people, although, to
please them, he caused the arrest of Cnæus Piso,
who was suspected of having poisoned Germanicus,
and who committed suicide before he was
sentenced.</p>

<p>At the same time Tiberius was completing the
concentration of power in his own hands and
began to employ <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">delators</i>, or spies, that he might
detect and punish the beginnings of all plots
against himself. He was suspicious of his subjects
at Rome. “I have a wolf by the ears,” he
said, referring to the great body of the people.
This being his attitude of mind toward them, it
is not strange that they lost for him their love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
loyalty. His son, another Drusus, who had grown
to be about thirty years old, was now associated
as a consul of the empire with him.</p>

<p>The career of Tiberius rose to a certain height
and then gradually declined. The turning-point
was when he received into his intimate confidence
an infamous adviser named Sejanus. He trusted
this man more than he did the experienced officers
of his realm. Sejanus was utterly selfish and corrupt,
and willing to stop at no point in his domination
of the emperor’s mind. Tiberius began to
manifest a depressed and morose spirit. He frequently
retired to the island of Capri, near
Naples, for relief and recuperation. There, upon
the high cliffs, amid beautiful scenery and the
soft breezes of a salubrious climate, he made for
himself extensive gardens and villas and gathered
around him servile flatterers, who ministered to
his vanity and catered to his caprices. He was
fascinated by oriental superstitions and employed
many sorcerors and magicians. Juvenal pictures
the scene of the emperor sitting on a rock of
Capri with his “Chaldeans” (that is, soothsayers)
around him.</p>

<p>Tiberius continued in a large measure to direct
through others the affairs of the empire. His
son, Drusus II, proved to be a man of ability and
discharged well the duties that were laid upon
him. But Sejanus was made prefect and had the
control of the city and of the Pretorian guard. It
was Sejanus who took the bold step of bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
all the soldiers of that guard,&mdash;nine or ten thousand
in number,&mdash;together into one camp, where
they could be more at his own bidding. This
camp was on the northeast border of Rome, where
the square projection in the line of the walls still
indicates its large proportions. Of course Drusus
was in the way of Sejanus’ unprincipled ambitions;
so the latter insidiously managed to gain
influence over the wife of Drusus; and these two,
Sejanus and this woman, together poisoned the
promising heir to the throne. Tiberius was deceitfully
told that the prince Drusus had died from
sickness only. It was a severe blow to his fondest
hopes. He manifested great grief before the
Senate and mournfully declared that he must now
transfer his hopes to the youthful children of
Germanicus.</p>

<div id="ip_54" class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;"><img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">DRUSUS</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile jealousies and recriminations prevailed
between Tiberius and his mother Livia as
one party, and Agrippina, the widow of Germanicus
and granddaughter of Augustus, as the other.
Agrippina was living at Rome with her fatherless
children, among whom was a third Drusus, a
Nero, and a Caius. Caius, under the name of
Caligula, was destined to be the next emperor.
Sejanus fostered this quarrel for his own ends.
He also encouraged the emperor in his deliberate
purpose to make his permanent residence in the
island of Capri, which Tiberius did soon after.
There the luxurious seclusion of the emperor was
guarded with the strictest vigilance; but day by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
day a regular service of couriers brought dispatches
to him from the continent and from Rome.
His commands, in turn, were transmitted to the
capital city.</p>

<p>Not long afterward Livia, the mother of the
emperor and the widow of Augustus,&mdash;from whose
somewhat officious oversight Tiberius had effected
his escape by retiring to Capri,&mdash;died at the advanced
age of eighty-six, having held for seventy
years nearly as much influence as any other personage
in the Roman court. She had been also
called Julia Augusta, on account of her marriage
to Augustus and her admission to the Cæsarian
family. She had combined ambition with prudence,
great ability with virtue and benevolence.
At her obsequies Caius, the youngest of the sons
of Germanicus, pronounced the eulogy.</p>

<p>In my sketch of the life of Augustus I have
described some of the apartments of Livia’s house,
with their ancient beautiful frescoes, which are
still to be seen among the ruins on the Palatine
Hill. Not far from the beginning of the Appian
Way the tourist, after nearly nineteen centuries,
also visits, with curiosity and wonder, a columbarium,
or great burial vault, so called from the
niches in the walls resembling those of dovecotes,
in which are believed to repose the ashes of
Livia’s numerous attendants, slaves and freedmen,
said to be more than a thousand in number.
This gives some idea of the opulence in which she
lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>It now remained for the unprincipled Sejanus
to get rid of Agrippina,&mdash;the widow of Germanicus,&mdash;and
her children, who caused him great uneasiness.
By his exaggerated accusations, Tiberius
was induced to send word to the Senate that
they must arrest and condemn them. In spite of
earnest opposition from the people, this was done.
Agrippina was sent into exile in the island of
Pandataria, now called Ventotienne, where she
is said to have starved herself to death in the year
A.&nbsp;D. 33,&mdash;the year of Christ’s crucifixion. Her
son Nero was sent into another island, called
Pontia. Another son, Drusus, was thrown into
prison at Rome. All of these afterwards came to
miserable deaths as the result of their ill treatment.
But another son, Caius by name, was
fortunate enough to be looked on with more favor
by the emperor and to be kept by his side at the
imperial resort in the island of Capri.</p>

<p>Sejanus, seeming now to be in full power, was
made consul by the emperor, to serve along with
himself. But it was not a great while before the
tide turned. Tiberius discovered the utter hollowness
and treachery of this man, so that in a time
when he least expected it Sejanus was summoned
before the Senate at Rome, the charges of the
emperor against him were read, and he was
thrown into the Mamertine prison. Upon others
also, besides Sejanus, the wrath of Tiberius fell.</p>

<p>Then, disappointed by those in whom he had
trusted, and embittered by his own successes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
tyranny, he began to divert himself at Capri with
debasing pleasures. He seemed to have thrown
off all the restraint of decency and to have given
himself up with his boon companions to the
wildest orgies of dissipation and vice. His ancient
biographers paint these scenes of his life in the
darkest colors. He had broken all the fair
promises of his earlier days and, instead of a
painstaking ruler, had become a self-indulgent,
besotted, and vindictive old man. The most
charitable view that can be taken of his life at
Capri is that his mind had become weakened by
his gloomy suspicions, by his absolute authority
and by his uncontrollable appetites.</p>

<p>Milton in his “Paradise Regained,” when he
represents Satan as tempting Christ with “all the
kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,”
represents the former as saying:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was certainly a very subtle form of temptation
to suggest to a noble mind, the thought of
supplanting a monarch who had become so reprobate
and vile.</p>

<p>The youth and early manhood of the famous
writer and philosopher, Lucius Annæus Seneca,
fell within the twenty-three years of the reign of
Tiberius. He had been born seven years before
the Christian era, at Cordova, in Spain. His
father was a man of knightly rank; and his
mother, Helvia, a Spanish lady, is praised by her
son for the nobility and sweetness of her character.
They were people of wealth, and had cultivated
tastes.</p>

<p>When Seneca was still a babe only two years old
the family migrated to Rome. He had two
brothers,&mdash;Marcus Annæus Novatus and Lucius
Annæus Mela. The latter was the father of
Lucan, the poet of Rome’s declining literature.
The former is known in history as Julius Gallio,
a name which he took when adopted by an orator
of that name. It was the same Gallio who became
deputy of Achaia in Greece and before whom
the Apostle Paul was dragged at Corinth by the
Jews, who were indignant at his success in preaching.
When some Greeks seized Sosthenes, the
ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the
judgment seat, Gallio “cared for none of those
things.” How little he dreamed that the one thing
that would keep his name before the ages would
be the fact that a Christian Jew, obscure at that
time, was brought for a few moments before his
tribunal! But he was popular in his day for his
culture and refinement and was called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dulcis
Gallio</i>,&mdash;the sweet Gallio.</p>

<p>Seneca had the best educational advantages of
his times. He studied rhetoric and philosophy.
From Sotion, a Pythagorean, he imbibed the doctrine
of the transmigration of souls, and from
Attalus, the Stoic, a hatred of “vice, of error, and
of the ills of life.” He learned in theory to
commend poverty, to despise luxury, and to declare
that the mind should be superior to its surroundings.
He was too far from Palestine to
have been brought in contact with the ministry
there of Christ and of his apostles, but it is striking
to remember (and here we may quote the
language of Dean Farrar) that “amid all the
guilty and stormy scenes in which his earlier
destiny was cast there lived and taught in Palestine
the Son of God, the Saviour of the World.”
While the young Seneca was being guarded by his
attendant slave through the crowded and dangerous
streets of Rome on his way to school, Saint
Peter and Saint Andrew were fisher lads by the
shore of Lake Gennesareth; while Seneca was
ardently assimilating the doctrine of Attalus,
Saint Paul with no less fervency of soul sat learning
at the feet of the Rabbi Gamaliel in Jerusalem,
and long before Seneca had made his way
through paths dizzy and dubious to the zenith of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
his fame, the Saviour of men, unknown to him,
had been cruelly crucified.</p>

<p>Seneca’s writings during the life of Tiberius
were chiefly on subjects drawn from nature and
on India and Egypt,&mdash;countries in which he had
been traveling. He won a high reputation in
literature. He had little to do with the imperial
court. He was not brought into any personal relation
with the emperor Tiberius, but not infrequently
in his pages refers to that “brutal monster”
and to the dangerous power of his prime
minister, Sejanus. We shall hear more of Seneca
farther on.</p>

<p>While a few men such as Seneca were beginning
to reach after higher things, the reign of Tiberius
was, on the whole, a period of dark skepticism, of
degraded morals, of manifold intrigues. Thoughtful
persons had lost faith in the old mythology,
the conventional paganism. Many were longing
for something better. Many had settled into the
worst pessimism. Various dreadful tragedies
went on in high life at Rome. There was a great
deal of contention, and much confusion among all
orders of citizens. Accusations and suspicions
were everywhere rife.</p>

<p>Twice during his residence at Capri Tiberius
determined to go back to Rome. Each time he
started from that mountainous island to make
the journey. He pursued it until he had come
near the imperial city. Then, without entering
Rome, he, in each case, took a meditative view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
its walls and buildings and turned back, terrified,
it was reported, by some evil omen. The last
time, as he was retracing his route through Campania,
he was taken ill at Asturia. At Cerceii he
presided at festive sports in the military camp,
even casting with his own hand javelins at wild
beasts, which were driven before his seat in the
amphitheater.</p>

<p>But this was too much for his physical strength.
Though he reached Misenum near Puteoli, he
could go no farther. There he died in A.&nbsp;D. 37,
when he was seventy-eight years old, at the close
of a reign of twenty years. His funeral was soon
after conducted with formal pomp by his successor,
and his body was laid in the mausoleum of
Augustus, at Rome.</p>

<p>Such was the emperor within the limits of whose
administration fell the greater part of the youth
and all the public ministry of Jesus Christ. It
seemed as if in his person selfish power was allowed
to run to every excess before divine mercy
should make its great manifestation and self-sacrifice
for mankind.</p>

<p>We read in Luke’s third chapter that it was in
the fifteenth year of this Tiberius Cæsar that
John the Baptist began to preach in all the country
about Judea. As Jesus was “about thirty
years old” when he came to John to be baptized,
we suppose Luke’s reckoning to be made from
the time that Tiberius became associated with
Augustus in the government. In that dark age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
there were many who were defying God and
going to every extreme of injustice and vice, but
there were others who were “waiting humbly and
prayerfully for the consolation of Israel.” How
startling to the former and how welcome to the
latter must have been the great forerunner’s cry
echoing in the wilderness of Judea: “Prepare ye
the way of the Lord and make his paths straight!”
Among the people who went out to hear John were
some of the soldiers of Tiberius, who were then
stationed in Palestine.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Do violence to no man, neither accuse any
falsely, and be content with your wages,” was his
reply.</p>

<p>Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great,
had been the tetrarch or ruler of Galilee under
the Roman emperor since the death of his father.
In his courageous zeal, John the Baptist did not
hesitate to rebuke even this Herod Antipas, because
he was then scandalously living with
Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. John,
therefore, was hated and thrown into prison, and
there remained until he was cruelly beheaded at
the request of Herodias, through her daughter,
who had pleased this Herod by her dancing in the
revels of his birthday feast.</p>

<p>When Jesus had begun his ministry in Galilee,
Herod hearing about him, said:</p>

<p>“John have I beheaded, but who is this of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
I hear such things? It is John the Baptist who
has risen from the dead.”</p>

<p>And he desired to see Jesus.</p>

<p>On another occasion some Pharisees came to
Jesus saying:</p>

<p>“Get thee out and depart hence, for Herod will
kill thee.”</p>

<p>And he said unto them:</p>

<p>“Go ye and tell that fox, Behold I cast out
devils and do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the
third day I shall be perfected.”</p>

<p>Herod’s desire to see Jesus was afterward
gratified in very remarkable circumstances. He
was temporarily in Jerusalem, having come south
from his city Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee, when
Jesus was brought before Pontius Pilate, the
Roman governor of Judea. Hearing that Jesus
was from Galilee, Pilate tried to turn the case
away and put the responsibility of deciding it
upon Herod by sending Jesus to him for examination.
But Jesus would not answer Herod’s interrogations;
and so, after ill-treatment by Herod’s
guards, he was sent back to Pilate, who had to
make the decision after all. He passed judgment
in spite of his hypocritical washing of his hands
in the presence of the mob.</p>

<p>We learn from secular history that one cause of
the unpopularity of Pilate with the people was
that, in removing some Roman troops from
Cesarea to Jerusalem, he had tried to bring into
the holy city the military standards that bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
image of the emperor Tiberius. The old religious
feelings of the Jews against any representation of
the human figure, especially when, as in this case,
it tended to idolatry, was roused to the utmost;
and their remonstrance had to be heeded. So
stirring were the events in Jerusalem taking
place while Tiberius was emperor at Rome.</p>

<p>It was the face of Tiberius, or of his predecessor
Augustus, that was on the Roman “penny”
or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">denarius</i> that Jesus once asked to be shown to
him. Seeking a pretext for accusing him before
the Roman authorities, his foes had inquired of
him:</p>

<p>“Is it lawful to pay tribute to Cæsar or not?”</p>

<p>Looking at the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">denarius</i>, Jesus said:</p>

<p>“Render unto Cæsar the things that are
Cæsar’s and unto God the things that are God’s!”</p>

<p>The government of Tiberius had, indeed, a
claim upon the tribute of its citizens, who enjoyed
its protection and used its coin: but that claim
should never interfere with their obligations to
the Supreme Ruler of all consciences.</p>

<p>Again, when the Jewish rabble tried to overcome
the scruples of Pilate by shouting:</p>

<p>“If thou let this man go thou art not Cæsar’s
friend,” it was to the fear of Tiberius in Pilate’s
heart that they appealed. Centurions, or captains
of a hundred men in the army of Tiberius,
appear in the scenes of the New Testament. It
was the shadow of Tiberius over the land that
was withholding from the Jews the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
put any man to death. They had to look to the
Roman authorities to do this; and then it was
accomplished not by the Jewish method of stoning
but by the Roman method of crucifixion.</p>

<p>Those were Roman soldiers, “the whole band of
them,” at Jerusalem, who so heartlessly derided
Jesus in the Governor’s hall. We read that “they
stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.” And
when they had platted a crown of thorns, they
put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand.
And they bowed the knee before him and mocked
him, saying:</p>

<p>“Hail, King of the Jews!”</p>

<p>And they spit upon him and took the reed and
smote him on the head. And after they had
mocked him they took the robe off from him and
put his own raiment on him and led him away to
Golgotha. Those were Roman soldiers that drove
the nails into his hands and feet.</p>

<p>“They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with
gall.”</p>

<p>They elevated him upon the cross, and then sat
down to gamble for his raiment, while they cast
occasionally a glance at his dying agonies. It was
the Roman centurion, commanding these soldiers,
who, seeing the earthquake and those things which
were done, feared greatly, saying:</p>

<p>“Truly, this was the Son of God!”</p>

<p>Afterward it was a Roman soldier that thrust
a spear into the side of the crucified, to make sure
that he was dead, and it was a group of them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
were placed as a watch at the sealed tomb. One
wonders if the miraculous facts about the life and
death and resurrection of Jesus were ever fully
reported to the emperor Tiberius and whether he
ever gave any consideration to their deep
significance.</p>

<p>Tiberius was not a great builder as Augustus
had been. Yet he built or enlarged the imperial
palace on the Palatine. It was on the north corner
of the hill and overlooked the Forum. Some
ruins of it remain, as well as some of the villas
that he erected on the island of Capri. There are
said to have been ten of the latter. Statues and
other relics of them now adorn the grounds and
halls of modern summer resorts near the spots
which he selected. A triumphal arch was erected
in his honor in the Roman Forum. After him
also was named the city of Tiberias, mentioned
in John vi, 23, which was built by the tetrarch,
Herod Antipas, to be the Roman capital of
Galilee, and which was adorned with a palace and
a stadium. On the edge of that Palestinian lake,
which is sometimes called in Scripture the Lake
of Gennesareth, sometimes the Sea of Galilee and
sometimes, from this city, the Sea of Tiberias,
the traveler finds to-day its modern representative,
broken and picturesque.</p>

<p>It was to me a memorable night when, many
years ago, I encamped, with some friends, among
its ruins and watched the storm, which, as often
in the days of Christ, had come up suddenly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
was raging on the waters. The fishermen, Simon
and Andrew and James and John, as they plied
their craft of old, could see across the waves the
walls of the palace by day and its gleaming lights
by night. And not far away in the city of Capernaum,
on the shore of the same lake, Matthew,
when he was an unpopular publican or tax-gatherer,
sat at the seat of the customs and took in
the tribute money, which was for the treasury and
government of Tiberius at Rome.</p>

<p>It is not more than fifteen miles away over the
hills to Nazareth, where Jesus was brought up;
and we may well suppose that the wonderful boy
sometimes came from there and looked down
from the precipitous cliff into that deep natural
basin where the lake lies and upon this city of
Tiberias upon its bank. The shores were then
inhabited by a great and busy population. About
twelve miles long and six miles broad, it was then
dotted by many a sail. Caravan roads connected
its cities, and many races and languages were
then represented there. Any youth from a rural
home would take rich delight in coming thither
and so getting into touch with the great outside
world. And it was the scene of so much of his
holy manhood’s ministry that it seems almost a
desecration that the name of Tiberias should also
have been fastened there. It has now little more
to attract the eye than the circling banks, the
rippling waters and the blue haze on the surrounding
hills. Yet to the Christian student,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
acquainted with its past and in love with the
character of Him who lived and taught there, it
has taken on an interest that belongs to no other
locality on earth.</p>

<p>It is thought to have been in the reign of Tiberius
that the two granite obelisks, known as Cleopatra’s
Needles, which in the nineteenth century
before Christ had been set up by Thothmes III,
a monarch of Egypt, before the Temple of the
Sun at Heliopolis, were removed to Alexandria
and placed in front of a temple dedicated to
Cæsar. In our own time they have been carried
very much further from their original location.
One of them stands on the Victoria Embankment
in London. The other is in Central Park, New
York. The latter is 68½ feet high and nearly 8
feet wide on each side of the base. Who knows
but that Joseph and Mary on their flight with the
sacred child into Egypt from Bethlehem looked
with wonder on its curious hieroglyphics at Heliopolis?
At any rate, as it stands now in the park
of an American city, it is a venerable and heavy
link between the life of to-day and far distant
ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Tiberius sits in the Vatican Museum. That is
to say, his marble effigy does. It was discovered
in modern times at Veii in Italy and has been
pronounced by antiquarian experts to be a genuine
representation of him. He appears as a young
man of fine figure and handsome face. With his
right hand he holds up a baton, with his left he
grasps a sheathed dagger between his knees; and
this seems to be a fitting emblem,&mdash;though not
perhaps intentional,&mdash;of his cruelty. Drapery is
thrown over his shoulder and across his lap. On
his head he wears a wreath. The ribbons that
fasten it hang down behind his neck. His forehead
is intellectual. The hair is cut straight
across it. The face is smoothly shaven. The lips
are thin. The other features are of generous size.
Some may discern in the figure the promise of a
strength and wisdom, which, also, was not fulfilled.
Others may see in the face only weakness
and a consciousness of posing. At any rate, the
statue helps us to make history real to the
imagination.</p>

<p>Why was this wicked man elevated to such
honor and power? The thought comes to us that
we have no such ancient portrait of the meek and
lowly Saviour, who, while Tiberius was reigning,
“went about doing good” and inviting the weary
and heavy-laden to come to himself for rest. No
sculptor from among Rome’s eminent artists was,
of course, ever commissioned with promise of rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
reward to perpetuate in bronze or marble the
form and features of the despised Nazarene.</p>

<p>This is one of the many facts that remind us
that the highest worth has often to wait long for
its appreciation. But that appreciation will come
at last. A few may turn aside from the busy
streets of Rome to contemplate in the Vatican
gallery this cold semblance of the unworthy man
who petulantly ruled the world when the cruel
cross was erected outside the walls of Jerusalem
and when the yearning arms of Love Incarnate
were stretched out in pain upon it. But the
Victim on that cross has gloriously triumphed
and has won His throne in millions of human
hearts.</p>

<div id="ip_71" class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">CALIGULA</div></div>


<p>The third Roman emperor was Caligula. His
real name was Caius. He was a son of Germanicus
and Agrippina first, and a grandson of Drusus,
who was a brother of the Emperor Tiberius.
On his mother’s side he was a great-grandson
of Augustus. Tiberius seems to have preferred
him for his successor to Tiberius Gemellus, his
own grandson.</p>

<p>Caius was brought up chiefly in the royal court
and was, as we have seen, in company with Tiberius
in much of the luxurious dissipation of that
monarch’s later days in the island of Capri.
Pampered and flattered, it is not strange that he
grew up conceited and arbitrary,&mdash;a spoiled
child.</p>

<p>It is said that when Caligula was a young boy he
was dressed in miniature military accouterments,
including the boots, and presented to the soldiers
of the prætorian guard. This greatly pleased
them, and drew from them the nickname of Caligula,
which means “little boot.” A bronze statue,
found at Pompeii, represents him at about that
time in his life, with his hair in long curls, ornaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of silver upon his cuirass, and his feet shod
as indicated. As a youth he seemed to have had
a weak constitution. He was very excitable and a
poor sleeper.</p>

<p>When he came to the throne he was for a short
time diligent and thoughtful. He sailed to the
island where his mother Agrippina I had perished
and brought back her ashes to Rome for burial in
the mausoleum of Augustus. A cippus, or monumental
stone, set up among others in the city and
erected probably by him, because mention is made
on it of his accession to the throne, was hollowed
out in the Middle Ages so as to be a standard
measure for three hundred pounds of grain and
as such was set up to be used by the public in the
portico of the City Hall. It is now in the court of
the Palace of the Conservatori on the Capitoline.
Caligula introduced some measures of wise statesmanship.
Then he gained for himself great popularity
by his fondness for public sports and his
lavish expenditures on great gladiatorial shows,
in which Tiberius had taken very little interest.
There seems to have been a great deal of enterprise
and dash about him.</p>

<p>But Caligula soon abandoned the spirit of discretion
and modesty. He showed no true interest
for his subjects. Very few of them, however, knew
of his unworthy tastes and conduct at Capri. He
had been greatly influenced for evil by the companionship
at court of Herod Agrippa, a grandson
of Herod the Great, who had taken the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Agrippa in compliment to Vipsanius Agrippa, the
prime minister of Augustus. We shall later learn
more of this Herod Agrippa I, for under the title
of Herod the King it is he who appears in the
twelfth chapter of the Acts. Agrippa had filled
Caligula’s mind with oriental ideas of what a
monarch should be, namely, one who should make
the people feel his absolute power and should
dazzle them at times with great parades and
startling spectacles. Accordingly, Caligula is
reported to have said, “Let them hate me, if only
they fear me.” It became very soon evident that
Caligula’s vanity, arrogance, and cruelty would
stop at no limits. He obliged Tiberius Gemellus,
his rival for the throne, to commit suicide. He
forced a similar fate upon other friends of Tiberius.
His morals were execrable. His defiance of
public opinion was shameless. He lived with his
own sister Drusilla in a disgraceful manner and,
when she died, decreed that she should be worshiped
as a goddess. He successively took three
wives from other men.</p>

<p>He distributed crowns to foreign princes.
Among these was his friend Herod Agrippa,
whom he allowed to repair to his tetrachy in Palestine,
going by the way of Alexandria. In that city
Herod Agrippa’s presence was made the occasion
of an insult to the Jews by the people of Alexandria.
Their governor, Avilius Flaccus, knowing
the repugnance of the Jews to all graven images,
instigated the Alexandrians to demand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
statues of the emperor be set up in the synagogues.
This pleased the intolerable arrogance of
Caligula. Augustus and Tiberius had allowed
themselves to be spoken of as divine in the provinces,
but they had forbidden the worship of
their pretended divinity at Rome during their
lives. A deputation of Jews went to Rome to
dissuade the emperor Caligula from sanctioning
any such idolatries in regard to himself. They
said they had prayed for him and had offered
sacrifices for him, but they feared Jehovah as the
only God. They were shocked by his blasphemy
and returned disheartened when he replied:</p>

<p>“Yes; you have offered sacrifices <i>for</i> me, but
not <i>to</i> me.”</p>

<p>He, thereupon, issued his order that a statue of
himself should be prepared to be worshiped even
in the temple at Jerusalem. He went so far as to
arrange for priests and sacrifices in his honor.
The governor of Syria told the workmen to proceed
slowly upon this statue; so that it was not
completed before Caius’s death.</p>

<p>Caligula seems really to have persuaded himself
that he was a god, not one of moral purity,
but, according to his own depraved idea, a god of
outward and sensuous power,&mdash;a Bacchus or a
Hercules. He caused himself to be adored in the
Forum. He showed himself to the people, sitting
between the statues of Castor and Pollux in their
temple.</p>

<p>“If you do not kill me I will kill you,” he cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
out to Jupiter in a thunderstorm, and then he
ridiculously invented a machine for imitating
thunder. He built some kind of a lofty passageway,
which was called a bridge, over the roofs of
the houses from the Palatine to the Capitoline, so
that he could go over and confer, as he said, with
Jupiter in his temple. Merivale says that “to
stand on the summit of a high basilica and scatter
money to the populace seemed to him an act of
divine munificence and to sail along the Campanian
coast in enormous galleys equipped with
porticos, baths, and banquet halls interspersed
with gardens and orchards delighted him as a
gorgeous parade and as a defiance to the elements.”
He also constructed at great expense a
bridge of boats across the bay from Baiæ to
Puteoli. This he did as a token of his power to
win a victory even over the god Neptune himself.
It was about two miles long. We may here quote
again from Merivale:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He ransacked, we are told, the havens far and near to collect
every vessel he could lay hands on till commerce was straitened in
every quarter and Italy itself threatened with famine. These
vessels he yoked together side by side in a double line extending
from one shore to the other. On this broad and well-compacted
base he placed an enormous platform of timber; this again he
covered with earth and paved it after the manner of a military
highroad with stones hewn and laid in cement. He determined
to enact on it a peculiar pageant, the novelty and brilliancy of
which should transcend every recorded phantasy of Kings or Emperors.
From Puteoli to Baiæ the semicircle of the bay was
crowded with admiring multitudes; the loungers of the baths and
porticos sallied forth from their cool retreats; the promenaders
of the Lucrine beach checked their palanquins and chariots and
hushed the strains of their delicious symphonies; the terraces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the gorgeous villas, which lined the coasts and breasted the fresh
and sparkling ripples, glittered with streamers of a thousand
colors and with the bright array of senators and matrons drowning
the terrors of a popular uprising which day and night beset
them, in shrieks of childish joy and acclamation. The clang of
martial music echoed from shore to shore. From Bauli the emperor
descended upon the bridge, having first sacrificed to the
gods, and chiefly to Neptune and Envy, arrayed in a coat of
mail adorned with precious gems which had been worn by Alexander
the Great, with his sword by his side, his shield on his
arm, and crowned with a chaplet of oak leaves. On horseback,
followed by a dense column of soldiers, he traversed the solid
footway and charged into Puteoli as a conquering foe. There
he indulged his victorious army with a day of rest and expectation.
On the morrow he placed himself in a triumphal car and
drove back exulting in the garb of a charioteer of the Green at
the games of the circus. The mock triumph of this entrance
was adorned by pretended captives represented by some royal
hostages from Parthia who were at the time in the custody of
the Roman government. The army followed in long procession.
In the center of the bridge the emperor halted and harangued
his soldiers on the greatness of their victory from a tribunal
erected for the purpose. He contrasted the narrow stream of the
Bosphorus and the Hellespont, only seven stades in width, with
the broad ocean which he had yoked with chains; and declared
that the exploits of Xerxes and Darius were trifles compared with
his mightier enterprise. After wearying both himself and his
hearers with this prodigious folly he distributed money among
them and invited them to a banquet. At nightfall the bridge
and the ships were illuminated with torches and at the signal
the whole curving line of the coast shone forth, as in a theater,
with innumerable lights.”</p></blockquote>

<p>All this was simply useless extravagance, the
wild freak of a madman, the whim of a childish
tyrant who confounded arbitrary power and
splendor with divinity. He did not know of any
better way of proving himself to be godlike.</p>

<p>It is possible that some thought of all this blasphemous
arrogance may have been in the Apostle
Paul’s mind when, in 2 Thess. ii, 4, he pictures
“the man of sin” to be revealed, as one “who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
called God or that is worshiped; so that he as
God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself
that he is God.”</p>

<p>In order to keep up his assumed character of a
god, Caligula had to accomplish, of course, many
mighty things. He completed the temple of Augustus
at Rome. He enlarged the imperial residence
on the Palatine with oriental extravagance,
connecting by descending porticos the palace of
Tiberius with the temple of Castor and Pollux.
He projected, and perhaps commenced, the great
Claudian aqueduct. He brought from Egypt and
erected in the Vatican circus the immense granite
obelisk, one hundred and thirty-two feet high,
which now stands in front of St. Peter’s, not very
far, indeed, from the locality where he placed it.</p>

<p>But Caligula was so jealous of other men that
he caused many statues and monuments that had
been erected by Augustus to be thrown down and
so broken that the names could not be restored to
the figures. He was so consumed with envy that
he had a passion for destroying every well-earned
reputation. He forbade the circulation of the
writings of Virgil, of Livy, and of other famous
authors whom Augustus had fostered, and of
whom the people were proud. He even threatened
to abolish the laws and make his own word and
will the rule for mankind. No personal excellence
could escape his erratic hostility.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that he should look with hatred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
upon the popularity of the distinguished Seneca.
This writer and philosopher we have referred to
as winning public approval in the days of Tiberius.
He had become a great advocate and was
beginning to express exalted opinions. Caius
prided himself on his brilliant wit, of which, indeed,
a few illustrations have come down to us;
but he could not tolerate such a noble and talented
man as Seneca. He was so displeased with him
that he singled him out for immediate execution;
but one of the emperor’s favorites whispered to
him that he need not take the trouble to extinguish
an expiring lamp, Seneca was in such poor health
at the time. So Seneca escaped, but withdrew
into obscurity for the rest of the reign of Caius
and devoted himself to his studies and meditations.
He abhorred the conduct of the emperor.
He speaks of “wretches doomed to undergo
stones, sword, fire, and Caius”; and described
Caius as one whose “face was ghastly pale with a
look of insanity, his eyes half hidden under a
wrinkled brow; his ill-shaped head was partly
bald, partly covered with dyed hair, his neck
covered with bristles, his legs thin and his feet
misshapen.” On the other hand Caius called
Seneca’s writings “mere displays” and “sand
without lime.”</p>

<p>This emperor spent fabulous sums on extraordinary
entertainments. It was the custom of
the times for the vulgar rich to lay out enormous
amounts of money upon the decorations and luxurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
provisions of their tables, and Caligula was
not to be surpassed in this regard by any of them.
Viands were set before his guests with fantastic
display, chiefly on account of their rarity and
costliness. The brains of peacocks and the
tongues of nightingales and flamingoes, besides
rare birds from distant regions, were only specimens
of the extravagant dishes, while pearls dissolved
by powerful acids placed in the wine
seemed to give an additional relish to the foolish
prodigality. He had the most richly furnished
banquet-halls, the most elaborate furniture, and
the most exquisite music that the empire could
furnish.</p>

<p>He was fond of imposing military demonstrations.
He celebrated with great pomp a barren
victory over the Germans. He made ridiculous
boasts over an invasion of Great Britain, an invasion
that was abandoned not far from that
country’s shores.</p>

<p>The people soon became very tired and disgusted
with Caligula’s revels and dissipations.
His extravagance, of course, required increased
taxation, and his capricious cruelty put every
man’s life in jeopardy. He seemed to delight in
causing suffering. It is declared that he told his
executioners to strike in such a manner that their
victims might feel themselves dying, and that
once, when a sufficient number of animals was
wanting, he commanded some of the spectators in
the amphitheater to be thrown to the wild beasts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
His imagination seems to have had a tendency to
dwell on cruel and grewsome thoughts, as the following
quotation will show:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One day at a public banquet, when the consuls were reclining
by his side, he burst suddenly into a fit of laughter and, when
they courteously inquired the cause of his mirth, astounded them
by coolly replying that he was thinking how by one word he
could cause the heads of both of them to roll on the floor. He
amused himself with similar banter even with his wife Cæsonia,
for whom he seems to have had a stronger feeling than for any
of his former consorts. While fondling her neck, he is reported
to have said, ‘Fair as it is, how easily I could sever it!’ He
did not content himself with such fancies. Too often they were
followed by actual cruelty and bloodshed, so that few could laugh
at his joking. There was no telling how he would shock the
public next.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“This prince,” said Seneca, “only lived to show
what the greatest vices could do in the circumstances
of the highest fortune.”</p>

<p>It may be asked: Where was the Roman
Senate? Had it no power in the time of such public
distress? The senators had more power than
they had courage to exercise. They were weak
and vacillating, each man fearing for his own life.
They were often struck dumb by his imperious
and remorseless demands, but the next day they
would meet and pay servile court to him.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Caligula’s reign was not
long. It lasted less than four years. The suppressed
and muttering storm of popular indignation
was long reaching its climax. But at last the
outburst came, and the merciless lightning fell.
He had presided on a certain occasion at the games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
at the foot of the Palatine. At the hour of intermission
and rest he allowed most of his guard to
go up into the palace by the open way, while he
entered through the cryptoporticus,&mdash;a long
tunnel-like passageway under the building, the
same one through the shadows of which the
modern visitor to the Palatine Hill now generally
passes. Hither Cassius Chærea, a tribune of the
Guard, whom Caligula had insulted by mockingly
imitating his squeaky voice, followed him, with
others, and arresting his steps, suddenly struck
him upon the head with a sword. Blow followed
blow till life was extinct. The bearers of his
litter had run to his assistance with their poles,
while his small body-guard of Germans had struck
wildly at the assassins. But these assassins made
their escape from the narrow passage, and left the
body where it fell. It was borne in secret by
friendly hands to a place of cremation, where it
was only partially consumed. Later his sisters,
Livia and Agrippina II, reduced it completely to
ashes, which they consigned to a decent sepulcher.</p>

<p>The people must have breathed more freely
when his death was announced, for they felt that
nothing worse could follow and something better
might. Caligula is not mentioned in the New Testament,
but he was carrying out his wild career
while the Gospel was spreading from Jerusalem
through Judea and Samaria and as far perhaps
as to Antioch. The preaching of Peter and
Philip and John, in Samaria, and the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of Saul of Tarsus at about that time would have
had no interest for him if he had been told about
it.</p>

<p>There is a bronze bust of him in the Hall of the
Emperors in the Capitoline Museum at Rome,
from which we would suppose him to be somewhat
good-looking. He had regular features and an
intellectual head, but wore a sort of frown upon
his brow. He did not part his hair. None of the
first emperors seem to have done that; so it was
probably the fashion for other men not to do it.
The bust represents him as wearing a corselet
over the woven garment that falls in folds from
his shoulders. There is some alertness and vigor
in the face. Perhaps in his youth he was a possible
statesman. If so, he was badly spoilt by his
early training in a hot-bed of corruption and
sensuality. His name is a black spot upon the
history of a period dark enough at best, and is
never mentioned but to be despised.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">CLAUDIUS, THE STOLID</span></h2>

<div id="ip_83" class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="449" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">CLAUDIUS</div></div>


<p>After Caligula’s death the Senate was convened
in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline
Hill,&mdash;not in the accustomed Curia or Senate
House, because that bore the now hated name of
Julian from the family to which the slain emperor
belonged. The body first of all issued decrees
denouncing the tyranny of Caligula and giving
honor to the “restorers of public freedom,” as the
assassins were called, and especially to the ringleader
of these, Chærea. They also granted a remission
of some of the most unpopular taxes that
Caligula had enforced. Some were ready to vote
that the memory of the Cæsars should be entirely
abolished and that the government should be restored
to the simple republican form it had in the
days of the Scipios and Cato. Others thought that
the monarchy should be continued, but in an entirely
different family line.</p>

<p>Chærea, emboldened by his public honors, gave
orders to a military tribune, who hastened to put
to death Caligula’s wife and only child. It was
properly a question for the Senate to decide,&mdash;who
should be the successor to the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
throne. While that body was deliberating, the
matter was summarily settled by the action of the
Prætorian Guards. In the general confusion some
of them had begun plundering the imperial palace.
There they had found, half-hidden behind a curtain
in an obscure corner, a man about fifty-five
years old, whom they recognized as Claudius, the
son of Drusus and the uncle of Caligula. He sank
at their feet probably expecting nothing but death.
But they dared not do otherwise than respect the
blood of the Cæsars. They were more loyal than
the great body of the Senators to the royal family.
So they hailed Claudius as emperor and carried
him, astonished and protesting, to their camp.
When in the morning it was found that the Senate
had come to no conclusion, Claudius found courage
to allow the soldiers to have their way and to
swear allegiance to him. In return for their devotion
he promised them a large donation in
money.</p>

<p>Herod Agrippa I, who had been such a friend
of Caligula and who was still in Rome, advised
the Senators that the wisest thing that they could
do would be to yield to the wishes of the soldiers.
This was an act for which, as we shall see, he was
afterward generously rewarded by Claudius. In
spite of some determined opposition, therefore, he
was proclaimed the successor to the throne, the
first of many Roman emperors who owed their
elevation to the military power of the prætorian
guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>Claudius was born at Lugdunum, or Lyons, in
Gaul, August first, in the year 9, or 10, before
Christ. From his childhood he seems to have been
weak in body and retiring in spirit. He had been
neglected, if not despised, by the great Augustus.
His own parents had been ashamed of him
as a feeble invalid. He had not been thought of
as worthy to fill any high office at the imperial
court. He had once asked the emperor Tiberius
for larger responsibilities, but had received
scarcely more than empty honors. He is said to
have had some form of paralysis, to have trembled
in his hands and to have had an imperfect utterance.
Caligula had elevated him to the consulship
and had given him an honorable seat at
public spectacles; but in private he had been
made the butt of coarse jokes and of much ridicule.
He had resigned himself, therefore, to quiet
pursuits, had settled down to the opinion that
there were no great things for him in life, and had
turned his attention to literary studies. He was
the author, with some assistance, of several historical
volumes and of a life of Cicero. He may
have been, for that period, a fair sort of citizen,
and when he was made emperor it was certainly
an agreeable change for the people from the outrageous
extravagancies of Caligula.</p>

<p>At the outset of his reign he modified some of
the harsh enactments of his predecessors; returned
to their owners several private estates,
which had been confiscated; gave back to various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
cities the statues of heroes, which had been removed
from them, and restored the temples, which
Caligula had desecrated, to their original uses.
He also executed the murderer of Caligula. Fearing
violence, he caused his own person to be
guarded. He respected the dignity of the Senate,
made the Senators responsible for the discharge
of their duties, and increased their number by
promoting to that honor men from the equestrian
rank.</p>

<p>In this matter he did not confine his view to
Italy but extended it to Gaul, the province in
which he had been born. He made a speech in the
Senate defending the measure. This speech was
copied on brazen tablets and preserved by the
people of Lugdunum (Lyons). One of these was
discovered three centuries ago and is now to be
seen, well preserved and clearly legible, in the
museum of that city. He discontinued all encouragement
to spies and informers. He ordained
that sick slaves abandoned in the temple of Esculapius
should be free if they recovered. He provided
also for the amusements of the people,
keeping up the popular gladiatorial shows and
sometimes going as far as to bandy jokes with
the bystanders about the performers. His responsibilities
developed in him unexpected independence
and force; and all these labors were not
unfavorable to the improvement of his health.</p>

<p>The Roman army was active at this time on the
frontiers of Gaul and Germany. Claudius determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
to carry out the plan that Augustus had
formed of invading Britain. He even entered that
country in person, crossing the channel and joining
the Roman general, Aulus Plautius, in his
campaign against the natives. He was absent
from Rome six months and achieved such military
success that on his return a public triumph
was accorded to him by the Senate. On this
occasion he added to his name the title Britannicus,
which afterwards became also the special
designation of his son.</p>

<p>A little later in the reign of Claudius, Caractacus,
a British chief, who had resisted the Roman
forces, was captured and brought to Rome, with
his wife and daughter. All at the imperial court
were impressed with the noble bearing of this
prisoner as he pleaded eloquently for his life.
Claudius, let it be said to his credit, extended to
him the imperial clemency. I shall have occasion
to refer to the invasion of Britain by Claudius
when I come to speak, in a later chapter, of Paul’s
friends at Rome and among them of the woman
Claudia and her possible British origin and
relations.</p>

<p>Claudius was generous and tactful with the
princes who were subject to the Roman empire.
He established Antiochus in Comagene, Mithridates
on the Bosphorus, for the favor I have mentioned,
and Herod Agrippa I in Galilee with Judea
and Samaria added to his domain. It was during
the reign of Claudius that this Herod Agrippa I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
“stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the
church,” as Luke records for us in the twelfth
chapter of the Acts. “And he killed James, the
brother of John, with the sword. And because he
saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
take Peter also.” Peter was wonderfully delivered
from prison. But Herod was soon after
smitten with a dreadful disease. It was when he
had made a proud demonstration before the
people, as is described to us in the same chapter
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their
country was nourished by the king’s country. And upon a set day
Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made
an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, “It
is the voice of a god and not of a man.” And immediately the
angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the
glory; and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost. But
the word of God grew and multiplied.</p></blockquote>

<p>The famous cities of Trèves in France, Cologne
on the Rhine, and Colchester in England owe their
origin to the reign of Claudius. The original
name of Cologne was Colonia Agrippinensis for
Agrippina, who was born in this vicinity. As
empress she assumed a leadership in military matters
never before occupied by a woman, and made
it her boast that she was the first of her sex thus
to found a colony of Roman veterans. Colchester,
meaning the camp on the river Colne, was on the
site of the ancient town of Camelodunum, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
residence of the principal potentate of southern
Britain, the chief of the Trinobantes. When these
people were put to flight, Claudius established
there a Roman camp and colony to keep them and
the other barbarous tribes in awe. They were
taught to ascribe the victory of the Romans to the
favor of certain divinities; and among the shrines
erected in the colony was a temple of unusual size
for the worship of Claudius himself. Such divine
honors, we have seen, had sometimes been accepted
by his predecessors. Two miles of city
walls and other relics dating from the period of
the Roman occupation may still be seen at
Colchester.</p>

<p>From Caius Caligula, Claudius had received an
exhausted public treasury and empty granaries.
Scanty harvests produced several periods of
famine in different parts of the world. Secular
historians say that one of these occurred in Palestine
and Syria during his reign. We read in Acts
ii, 28, how such a famine was predicted by the
prophet Agabus at Antioch, so that the disciples
there determined to send relief to their brethren
in Judea, which they did by the hands of Barnabas
and Saul; and the sacred writer says this famine
occurred in the days of Claudius Cæsar. As one
of the means for bringing Egyptian wheat to
Rome more quickly, and thus preventing such periods
of destitution of bread in the imperial city
again, Claudius directed the building of a larger
harbor at the mouth of the Tiber, an enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
that required much massive masonry and which
for a long while facilitated the commerce of the
empire. In course of time the action of stream
and wind and tide has filled up and wellnigh obliterated
it. He also in seven years carried on to
completion the mighty aqueduct for bringing water
to Rome from the Alban hills,&mdash;an engineering
achievement that has been always known as
the Claudian Aqueduct. The traveler still wonders
at its great arches stretching across the
lonely Campagna. Tunneling a mountain to afford
a better outlet for Lake Fucinus was another
great piece of engineering in his day, the completion
of which was fitly celebrated by naval evolutions
and a sham battle on the Lake.</p>

<p>If we could confine our view of Claudius to the
facts now stated, we might think of him as one who
in many respects quite disappointed the low estimate
of him that the majority of men held at the
beginning of his career. But, alas! his great weakness
lay in his proneness to be too easily duped
and controlled by others. This was specially
marked in the influence over him of his vicious
wives. The first lady who was betrothed to him
in his youth was repudiated by him because she
was not approved by the emperor Augustus. The
next died on the day appointed for the nuptials.
The third, named Urgalania, became the mother
of two children. One of these was choked to death
by a pear he tried to swallow. Afterward Claudius
divorced this wife, having discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
she was unfaithful; and he ordered her second
child to be exposed to die. The next wife was also
divorced as unsuitable. The last two were Messalina
and Agrippina, both of whom, as we shall see,
lived to acquire great infamy.</p>

<p>Messalina, the granddaughter of Mark Antony,
was married to Claudius when he had no prospect
of coming to the throne. She is said to have been
at that time only fifteen years old. She became an
intensely ambitious woman, of no moral principle.
She was particularly jealous of Julia and Agrippina,
the two nieces of the emperor, who, like
herself, were brilliant but wicked women. She
had no respect for her husband, and when he became
emperor used her position to gain her personal
ends. She was frightfully immoral. Her
name, indeed, has become a byword for female
depravity. She took bribes from others and
wheedled presents from her husband.</p>

<p>After the accession of Claudius, the philosopher
Seneca had emerged from the obscurity into which
the jealousy of Caligula had forced him. It would
have been well for his own peace of mind if he
had continued to pursue his reflections in private.
It has been well said that all Seneca gained for
himself from his career of ambition at court was
to be suspected by one emperor, banished by a
second, and murdered by a third.</p>

<p>Claudius was not only under the influence of an
infamous wife but he had also given himself
largely to be controlled by certain evil men chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
from the ranks of freedmen. The lower class of
Roman slaves had little hope of bettering their
condition. But there was a higher class, principally
from Greece and Syria, who were finely
trained and educated, and who could calculate on
obtaining their freedom early in life, when they
might come into many opportunities of being the
favorite employees, if not the intimate counselors,
of their former masters and others. Some of them
were shrewd enough to rise to great distinction
and power and figure prominently upon the pages
of history. In the court of Claudius there were
several freedmen of this character. There were
Narcissus, his private secretary; Polybius, his literary
adviser, and Pallas, his accountant. We may
also include another freedman of whom we read
in Scripture, Felix, the brother of Pallas, who became
the procurator of Judea, before whom the
Apostle Paul was arraigned. The first three of
these men, if not the fourth, became noted for
their accumulation of great riches and for their
insolence. Some scholars,&mdash;such as Lightfoot and
Ramsey,&mdash;have thought that the Narcissus we
here speak of was the man some of the slaves of
whose household were known to the Apostle Paul
to be Christians and secured from him greetings
in Romans xvi, 11.</p>

<p>Narcissus, Polybius, and Pallas gradually came
into control of the execution of the laws. Two of
them, Narcissus and Pallas, acquired their wealth
often by dishonest means. Once when Claudius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
complained that the imperial revenues were too
small, it was replied that he would be rich enough
if his two wealthy freedmen would take him into
partnership. By their accusations they obtained
from Claudius severe judgments on different individuals
whom they hated. He was aroused by
them to put down some conspiracies against his
own person, but seems scarcely to have been aware
of many evils that were flourishing while he was
maintaining the routine of government or presiding
at splendid banquets. At these he disgraced
himself by gluttony and intemperance. A stolid
worker in his prime, he became a stupid dotard in
his age.</p>

<p>The Roman court had now become so degenerate
that its record takes the form of a scandalous
chronicle. It was surely a miserable place for a
man to be found who put forth, as did Seneca,
exalted apothegms of moral philosophy. Using
opportunities for the investment of inherited
wealth, he became extremely rich and, although he
was one of the most enlightened men of his age,
he had allowed himself to be placed in a most contaminating
environment. Perhaps it was his detestation
of the conduct of the empress that made
him a partisan of her rivals, so that Messalina
could find a pretext for accusing him of an intrigue
with Julia. Julia was exiled and then put
to death.</p>

<p>No positive evidence of Seneca’s guilt has come
down to us. On the contrary, he has been pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
innocent by some students of history.
But he was condemned by the Senate and banished
to the barren shores of Corsica. He tells us that
Claudius tried to prevent this, but Messalina’s
schemes were too deeply laid to be thwarted. It is
remarkable that Seneca does not abuse her in any
of his writings that have come down to us. He
bade farewell to his noble-minded mother and his
beloved brother Gallio, to his nephew Lucan, the
promising young poet, and to Marcus his little
boy, and then left the city, banishment from which
was the sorest of trials to a Roman. He retired
to his place of exile. There, amid disagreeable
surroundings, he consoled himself with his philosophy
and wrote a “Consolation” to his mother,
Helvia, which is one of the noblest of his works.
It must, however, be admitted that his fine moral
precepts did not prevent his writing a letter to
Polybius in which he abjectly flatters Claudius,
manifestly in order to secure his release and his
return to Rome. If he expected this through the
intervention of Polybius, he was disappointed, for
that freedman and favorite, though he had formerly
much influence with Messalina, soon forfeited
his life through her machinations.</p>

<p>Messalina succeeded a long time in concealing
her real character, but when her shamelessness
reached its highest pitch in her open marriage to
another man, the indignation of the emperor was
aroused. Then followed a new scene of tragedy.
She had apparently persuaded Claudius that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was a mock marriage for a frolic, but all Rome
knew better and regarded it not only as a vile procedure
but an attempt to usurp the political
throne. Some time before this, Messalina had
coveted the gardens on the Pincian Hill, which had
long been famous as the property of the luxurious
Lucullus, and which at the present day may be a
part of the grounds of the Villa Medici. After
Lucullus it belonged to Valerius Asiaticus. So
Messalina had suborned her son’s tutor, Silius,
to accuse Asiaticus of corrupting the army. Thus
she secured his death and then took possession of
the gardens. Here, as the wild revelries that
followed the detestable wedding ceremonies were
at their height, one of the guests, Vettius Valens,
climbed to the top of a tree; and, when they asked
what he saw, he replied in language intended for
a jest:</p>

<p>“I see a fierce storm approaching from Ostia.”</p>

<p>It was well known that the emperor was at that
place. The storm was indeed approaching. Messengers
soon arrived, saying Claudius was on the
way. The news fell like a thunderbolt. Messalina
implored the protection of Vibidia, the chief
of the Vestal Virgins. With her children she
hastened across the city to the Ostian gate to
plead for the emperor’s mercy on his arrival.
She mounted the cart of a market gardener, which
happened to be passing. But Narcissus absorbed
the attention of the emperor as she approached by
accounts of her crimes; and Messalina was coldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
passed by. That evening, as Claudius enjoyed
the pleasures of his table, he showed some signs
of softened feeling at mention of her. Narcissus
knew that delay would be dangerous to himself.
So he sent a tribune and centurions to kill the
empress in the garden of Lucullus, to which she
had returned. She was weeping in despair when
the doors were battered down and the tribune and
his men stood before her. She took a dagger in
her hand and when she had twice stabbed herself
in vain the tribune gave the fatal blow. In her
death she has been well compared with Jezebel of
old, who was slain on or near the ground she had
wickedly taken from its owner. Claudius was still
lingering at his dinner when he was informed that
she had perished. He asked no questions and
manifested no emotion.</p>

<p>Not long after this the emperor married Agrippina
II, the sister of Caligula, and the daughter
of Germanicus and the older Agrippina. To distinguish
her from her mother she is generally
called Agrippina the Second. She was a niece of
Claudius.</p>

<p>The marriage of such close relations was repugnant
to most Romans. But the artful woman
managed to overcome all objections, and the
wedding took place. She had inherited none of
the virtues of her distinguished parents, had been
brought up by wicked relatives, and had been
married to Cnæus Domitius Ahenobarbus, one of
the worthless young nobles of that day. By him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
she had one son, upon whom she lavished her
natural affections. After her marriage to the
emperor she worked constantly in the interests of
this son, cherishing for him the greatest expectations.
One of her first steps was to secure his
betrothal to Octavia, the daughter of the emperor.
She also induced Claudius formally to adopt him
into the Claudian family, to place him in the line
of succession with his own son, Britannicus, and,
inasmuch as he was three years older than Britannicus,
to give him actual precedence in many
honors. On this adoption the young man received
a new name and became known as Claudius Domitius
Nero.</p>

<p>Agrippina also managed to get rid,&mdash;by banishment,
disgrace, or death,&mdash;of one after another
of the women who had been her rivals at the imperial
court. Among these were Lepida and Calpurnia.
Against the rich Lollia Paulina she
brought a charge of sorcery and treason, and so
obtained the confiscation of most of her property
and her banishment from Italy. It is said that
not even this satisfied her, but that she sent a
tribune to bring her the head of her enemy, and
that when it was laid before her she lifted the
lips with her own hand to make sure, by marks
on the teeth, of its identity. This horrid story
is quoted by Merivale and others from the ancient
historian, Dion. It has been well said that she
must have even surpassed Lady Macbeth in her
malignant and frigid cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Tacitus says that it was with a hope of counteracting
the unpopularity that these horrors had
aroused in the public mind that Agrippina recalled
Seneca from his exile in Corsica and made
him the tutor of her son. Thus, again, was this
great philosopher brought back into the scenes of
court and the public life at Rome. And thus
Agrippina would undo some of the work of Messalina,
whom she had heartily hated. She may
have been influenced also by the consideration
that Seneca was indignant with Claudius, and this
might make him more helpful to her and to her
son if any antagonism should arise between her
and her husband. Of course, it would have been
better for Seneca if he had stayed in Corsica. He
came back into a most perilous environment. He
may have been encouraged to do so by the knowledge
that a man of the old faithful type, Afranius
Burrus, was to have the very important post of
prefect of the prætorian guard. Perhaps these
two men were patriotic in their purpose and
trusted that they were going to be able to keep
matters from growing worse.</p>

<p>Agrippina, while she left to the emperor the
friends he liked and all the insignia of power,
constantly abused his confidence. It is strange
that he was so pliant to her scheming and malicious
will. He seems to have been, ordinarily, dull
and stupid, but when aroused he was impulsive
and vindictive. At last his freedman and secretary,
Narcissus, began to open his eyes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
extent to which he had been duped by his wife and
to her disregard of all obligations to him. He
seemed deeply moved by the discovery and remarked
that it had been his fate always to bear
and then to punish the wickedness of his wives.</p>

<p>These words, repeated to Agrippina, showed
her clearly that if she was going to succeed in her
purpose of getting the throne for her son, Nero,
it would not do for her to risk any delay. She
knew that she could do nothing injurious to her
husband in the presence of his secretary, Narcissus.
So she arranged with the physician of Narcissus
that he should be sent away to some medicinal
springs for his health. When he was gone she
proceeded with her atrocious plan. By some means
she secured the connivance of Halotes, the emperor’s
prægustator (the slave whose duty it was
to protect him from poison by tasting every dish
before it was presented to him) and of Xenephon
of Cos, his physician. Then she consulted with
Locusta, the infamous woman who is known to
have been a professional poisoner, often resorted
to in those turbulent days. The very existence of
such a person is a frightful indication of the prevailing
enormities. A compound was sought that
might be best suited for the special purpose, not
too rapid in its action to excite suspicion and not
too slow, lest Claudius should have time to arrange
something for Britannicus. The poison was
administered to him in a dish of mushrooms, of
which he was extravagantly fond. It is said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Agrippina herself handed him a choice morsel of
the food when he was somewhat intoxicated, and
it immediately caused him to be silent. Afterward,
when there were indications that, on account
of his gluttony, it might be ineffective, a physician
was induced, under pretense of causing vomiting
and so giving him relief from pain, to thrust a
feather smeared with a deadly liquid down his
throat. This completed the wicked work. Before
morning this Cæsar was a corpse.</p>

<p>While all these exciting scenes were taking
place in the reign of Claudius, the Apostle Paul
had been prosecuting his wonderfully earnest
ministry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and was
making missionary journeys in Asia Minor, Macedonia,
and Greece. It is in connection with his
meeting Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth that we
read in Acts xviii, 1, that “Claudius had commanded
all the Jews to depart from Rome.” The
Roman historian, Suetonius, speaks of this decree
and says it was issued because the Jews were
“constantly making a disturbance, Chrestus being
the instigator.” No prominent Jew named Chrestus
being otherwise known in the records of that
time, some have queried whether Chrestus may
not be here a Latin corruption of the Greek word
Christos, and whether these disturbances among
the Jews may not have been disputes about the
Christ, or Messiah, whom they expected, or even
about Jesus as claiming to be that Messiah. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
suggestion is interesting, but we cannot prove it
to be correct.</p>

<p>Like his predecessors, Claudius is represented
to us by ancient art in the shape of many statues
and busts. The one chosen to illustrate these
pages shows him to us in a flattering manner, as
if he possessed the attributes of Jupiter. He is
standing half-draped, with a wreath of oak leaves
about his head, his left hand upraised to grasp
the upper end of a long staff, and with an eagle
at his right foot. The figure is not without some
majesty, but there seems to be a look of anxiety
and weariness upon his face. Surely, he had
enough to make him anxious and weary in both
his public and his private life. Unexpectedly
called upon to be an emperor, he had wrought industriously
in the public service; but he had not
been equal to the moral strain of such a high
position and had been the undiscerning dupe of
iniquitous and malicious enemies. His worst foes
had been those of his own household.</p>

<span class="subhead">NERO, THE CRUEL</span></h2>

<div id="ip_102" class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="445" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">NERO</div></div>


<p>Lucius Domitius Nero, the next Roman emperor,
was, as we have seen, the stepson of
Claudius and the grandson of the famous Germanicus,
who was a brother of Claudius. His
mother was Agrippina II, the sister of Caligula.
This Agrippina became the last wife of Claudius;
but Nero was her son by her former husband, Lucius
Domitius. The Domitian gens, or family, had
been a famous one for several generations and
the particular branch of it to which Nero’s father
belonged, namely, the Ahenobarbi, or brazen-beards,
had long been prominent for its ability,
its wealth, and its power. At the same time it
had been noted for the faithlessness and ferocity
shown by many of its representatives. Suetonius
tells the story that the first Lucius Domitius, the
founder of the line, was the man to whom Castor
and Pollux announced the victory that had taken
place at Lake Regillus, when they rode into Rome,
and that his beard was then changed from black
to red in token of that supernatural manifestation.
The Ahenobarbi always inherited, it is said, the
complexion as well as the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>When Nero was three years old his father died.
His uncle, the emperor Caligula, managed to cheat
him out of his inheritance, but afterward the emperor
Claudius restored it to him, added to it
other property, and bestowed upon him many
honors. His mother sought to have him properly
educated and to have his manners cultivated according
to the best standards of the time. He is
said, as a boy, to have been affectionate, with
some aptness to learn, and fond of praise.</p>

<p>As the niece of Claudius, Agrippina had been
allowed to occupy a place in the imperial palace
next to the empress Messalina herself. When
Messalina’s dissolute character became manifest
to all, Agrippina, as we have related, took advantage
of it to increase her own favor with the
emperor and the interests of her son as a possible
successor to the throne. It was an audacious
dream, because he would be thus put in the place
of Britannicus, the emperor’s son by Messalina.
After Messalina’s wretched death, and when
Agrippina had reached the summit of her ambition
and had become the wife of Claudius (the
Senate having passed a special edict to sanction
this union of an uncle with his niece), this artful
woman was able still more successfully to make
her own son prominent and to keep Britannicus
in the background.</p>

<p>We have stated that the philosopher Seneca was
called back from the exile, in which,&mdash;probably
owing to the hatred of Messalina,&mdash;he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
living on the island of Corsica; and was chosen
to be the special instructor of the young Nero.
Seneca was not only a keen theorist in statesmanship
and morals but he was shrewd also in
matters of business, and had a taste for public
affairs. He was probably as good an instructor
as could have been found for such a service at
that time. He was, however, very lenient with his
royal pupil. He found in him a coarse nature with
strong impulses. He adopted the plan of trying
to allure him to his tasks by indulging him at other
times in his lighter tastes. The young man became
proficient in singing, in playing upon pipes,
and in dancing, though these accomplishments had
been disapproved by conservative Romans as inappropriate
to the military life of the conquerors
of mankind. But Seneca seems to have gone
further in yielding to Nero’s natural inclinations.
He connived at some of his vices. Surrounded by
flatterers and schemers and depraved caterers to
immorality, Nero early imbibed evil principles
and adopted corrupt practices. He was inflated
with conceit and bred to foolish ostentation. The
wickedness of his own mother must have gone far
to destroy in him all sentiments of virtue. What
could be expected of an impulsive young man with
such an heredity and such an environment?</p>

<p>While he was put forward to be the public advocate
of measures that were popular, Agrippina
reserved for Britannicus nothing but neglect. The
attendants of the latter’s childhood, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
whom and himself there had sprung up a mutual
affection, were, one by one, removed from him
through her influence, and he was left as much as
possible in the shadow.</p>

<p>When Claudius was dead Agrippina put the
climax upon her crafty management by keeping
the announcement from the public until everything
was ready. She even gave out word that
her husband was better and took care to retain
Britannicus and his sisters under her close surveillance.
To those in the palace who knew that
Claudius was dead she pretended the greatest
grief until noon of the next day. Then, when
Burrus the Prefect walked across the courtyard
to present the successor to the throne to the prætorian
guard, it was not Britannicus but Nero
that walked by his side. Some, indeed, ventured
to express the murmur:</p>

<p>“Where is Britannicus?”</p>

<p>But there was no one to champion his cause;
and so the son of Agrippina was saluted as the
emperor. It is also related that on the first evening
of his imperial power, when a sentinel of the
palace came to ask him for the watchword for the
night, he, knowing well to whom he was indebted
for his throne, returned the words, “Optima
Mater,”&mdash;“The Best of Mothers.” To what
extent this feeling of gratitude was maintained by
him in later years we shall see.</p>

<p>Seneca, poet and philosopher, is said to have
written a satire on the death of the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Claudius. The Senate, following foolish precedents,
had declared that he had become a god.
This satire represented him as having become a
gourd. The Senate had ascribed to him divinity.
The satire spoke jocosely of his pumpkinity.
Some eulogists of the philosopher are loth to believe
the identity, but many writers contend that
this satire was substantially the same as the well-known
ancient writing called the “Play Upon the
Death of Nero” that has come down to us, which
bears many of the marks of Seneca’s style and
which describes in a burlesque manner the reception
and disgrace of Claudius among the gods.
It is overflowing with contempt for the emperor,
in strange contrast with the almost abject flattery
that Seneca had written of him when he was
anxious to win his favor and so get back from
exile. Altogether, it is difficult to relieve Seneca
from the charge of time-serving and hypocrisy. It
is so much easier to write noble sentiments in regard
to disinterestedness than it is to practice
them in days of temptation! From ridicule of the
dead emperor the satire goes on to welcome the
new one in flowery language. It says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As when the bright sun gazes on the world and starts his
chariot on his daily race; so Cæsar breaks upon the earth. Such
is the Nero whom Rome now beholds!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nero was seventeen years of age when he was
thus called to govern the civilized world. Wearied
by the atrocities of his predecessors, the people
could not but welcome the fair-faced youth in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
whose antecedents there was not much to excite
serious apprehension. His busts represent him as
having at this time a round face, a not displeasing
countenance, and a slight beard. His hair is said
to have been yellowish, or sandy. His figure was
not well proportioned,&mdash;his neck being thick, his
body large and his legs slender. His eyes were
dark gray and their sight was somewhat impaired.
He was careless in his dress, yet fond of finery.
He particularly took care of his locks, arranging
them in a manner somewhat effeminate. He sometimes
greatly offended fastidious taste by going
with his feet bare, with his girdle loose, and wearing
(even in public) a sort of dressing-gown. He
entered upon his imperial career with a good
degree of physical health and strength.</p>

<p>From his very accession Nero felt uneasy on
account of the jealousy of Britannicus. He knew
that the sense of right would assert itself in the
breasts of many in behalf of Britannicus and
might become dangerous to his reign. He therefore
proceeded with caution. He pronounced a
funeral oration over Claudius, which Seneca is
believed to have composed for him. In it he made
many conciliatory promises. There were not any
of the nobles who had courage to call in question
his claims. They cared not to risk their heads
simply for the sake of a mere righteous succession.
They preferred to tolerate him as long as
he treated them with respect. They held the weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of his title to the throne as a weapon to be
used against him if he should offend them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Seneca and Burrus, the young emperor’s
principal advisers, did all they could to
make his government a good one and so establish
its authority. Their chief difficulties were to control
his headstrong nature and to prevent his
mother from exercising too much influence over
him. She, who had supplanted Messalina and
had murdered Claudius, was not going to let her
power go, if she could help it. She leagued herself
with Pallas, the wealthy and unprincipled
freedman at court, and it soon became evident
that she was making trouble.</p>

<p>Her son, too, at first was too ready to give her
honors. She was borne in public in the same
litter with him. She caused coins to be stamped
having her head with his upon them. She sent
dispatches to foreign courts and gave answers to
ambassadors. She even ordered the murder of
Silanus, the proconsul of Asia, who was obnoxious
to her. Burrus and Seneca were alarmed at her
bold assumptions of authority. They determined
to break down her power at any cost. To draw
away Nero from confiding too much in her they
even favored his intrigue with a freedwoman
named Acte, which greatly enraged Agrippina.
And this rage was increased when Nero removed
Pallas from his position of influence and dismissed
him from court.</p>

<p>Agrippina then declared herself the patroness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of Britannicus, notwithstanding she had set him
aside to bring Nero to the throne, and she appealed
to the army to make that young man now
the emperor in the place of her son. Nero saw
there was danger of a revolution. He therefore
adopted the iniquitous course then so common
with jealous rulers. He had Britannicus poisoned.
The poison, it is said, was prepared under the
emperor’s own eyes and was administered in the
wine-cup of Britannicus as he sat at a banquet
in the palace. The youth fell back lifeless, but
Nero passed the occurrence by as one of the fits,
to which, he said, his brother was subject. That
same night the corpse of Britannicus was
solemnly cremated with funeral ceremony on the
Campus Martius.</p>

<p>Nero then tried to divert attention from the
event and to cover up his crime by showering
presents, houses, and estates on the favorites of
the palace. The much praised philosopher,
Seneca, extolled the clemency of Nero during this,
the first year of his reign; yet this cool and calculated
murder of Britannicus seems to have occurred
within the limits of that year. Seneca
probably tried to excuse himself by saying that, if
Nero should not be sustained, Agrippina would
flourish in her power; and that would be worse for
the public weal. Meanwhile, he directed the administration
of the national affairs in a manner to
please the Senate and made the first five years of
Nero a prosperous time for the great body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
people. They were afterward spoken of as a
period of great happiness. This must have been
largely in contrast with the great gloom that followed;
yet doubtless Nero was to a great extent
then pliant to the advice of his tutor and the
prefect.</p>

<p>Nero prudently declined having magnificent
statues erected in his honor. He reserved severe
measures for notorious criminals, and seems even
to have been touched at times with emotion of
compassion. Seneca, to increase the youthful
emperor’s popularity, circulated an anecdote of
him to the effect that when asked to affix his signature
to an order for the execution of a condemned
person he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How I wish that I did not know how to write.”</p>

<p>But these moments of tenderness seem to have
been only of short duration. The spirit which
had been manifested in the poisoning of Britannicus
soon reappeared in other acts of meanness
and cruelty. He had been trained from his childhood
in too hard and selfish a school.</p>

<p>The emperor’s mother, Agrippina, was continuing
to plot against him, and her various designs
to disenthrone him were, of course, reported
to him. This disturbed him in the midst of the
recklessness with which he was carrying on his
debaucheries with his boon companions. “The
Best of Mothers,” as he had called her on his
accession, had now become the worst of his relentless
enemies. She seems to have allowed all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
maternal affection for him to be chilled by the
disappointment of her love of personal power.</p>

<p>For our knowledge of those times we are indebted
largely to the “Annals” of Tacitus. Some
questions arise as to the reliability of his accounts.
Josephus, who, as a foreigner, may have been
more impartial, says that different historians of
Nero’s reign were swayed by opposite prejudices;
yet he believed in the poisoning of Britannicus
and in other cruel murders by Nero now to be
related.</p>

<p>Poppæa Sabina, one of the fairest but wickedest
women in Rome, aspired to supplant Octavia, the
emperor’s wife, and concentrated her fascinations
upon him. Nero sent her husband to a distant
province and she suffered him to depart without
a sigh. Nero’s mother, Agrippina, was of course
much in the way of Poppæa’s designs, so Poppæa
laid her plan most diligently to get rid of the older
woman. She taunted the emperor with being
afraid of his mother and put before him all the
movements of Agrippina in the darkest light,
until Nero was persuaded. His regard for his
mother was already changed to hatred.</p>

<p>With the aid of Anicetus, the commander of the
fleet at Misenum,&mdash;who had a spite against Agrippina,&mdash;a
plan was formed by which she was induced
to embark on a barge, which, at a given
signal, was to break in pieces. The plan was not
successful. The mechanism failed to work. Yet
the sailors managed to tip the ship so that Agrippina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and her companions were thrown into the
water. She succeeded by the aid of some fishermen
in reaching the shore in safety. Seeing that
her only chance lay in dissimulation, she sent one
of her freedmen to tell her son that by the mercy
of heaven she had escaped from a terrible accident,
but that he need not be alarmed and must
not come to her, as she greatly needed rest and
quiet.</p>

<p>When Nero received the account he was thrown
into the greatest anxiety, knowing that now his
mother had discovered his plot against her and
would certainly seek revenge. In great agitation
of mind he sent for Burrus and Seneca to come to
him instantly. Laying before them the situation,
he looked from one to the other in suspense for
their advice. There was a long and painful
silence. At last Seneca asked Burrus if the
soldiers could be trusted to put her to death.
When the reply was given that the prætorians
would do nothing to injure a daughter of Germanicus
and that Anicetus should complete the
work he had begun, Anicetus showed himself
willing to do so. He trumped up another charge
against Agrippina and hurried off to her villa at
Bauli. There he and his minions found her in a
dimly lighted chamber, attended by a single hand-maid,
who immediately rose to steal away.</p>

<p>“Dost thou, too, desert me?” said the wretched
Agrippina.</p>

<div id="ip_112" class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;"><img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="448" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">AGRIPPINA II AND NERO</div></div>

<p>The armed men surrounded her couch. Anicetus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
was the first to strike. The rest immediately followed
his example, and she was dispatched with
many blows. Almost with her last breath she
cried out against the perfidy of her ungrateful
son.</p>

<p>If we are to believe many writers, Nero never
ceased after this murder of his mother to be
troubled with a guilty conscience. Yet he wrote
at the time a letter to the Senate from Naples declaring
that his mother had conspired against his
life and that in the confusion caused by her detection
she had miserably perished by her own hand.
The disaster of the ship he declared to have been
purely accidental. It is painful to record the
altogether probable fact that the real author of
this shameful document was Seneca, who thus put
the emperor’s message into words for him. It
affirmed that the death of the imperious woman
should be regarded as a public benefit. But such
declarations from such a source gave little satisfaction.
So widely was Nero believed to be guilty
of Agrippina’s murder that at Rome the sack,
the instrument of death for parricides, was secretly
hung about his statues and the names of the
triad of conspicuous matricides, Nero, Orestes,
and Alcmæon, were found posted by night upon
the walls. Yet the nobles were servile enough to
welcome him back with honor, and the populace
was diverted and gratified by the new and extravagant
shows that he provided for all. The
multitude even cheered him as he threw aside all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
his dignity as an emperor and went himself upon
the stage as an actor or drove recklessly in the
Circus Maximus as a charioteer. He delighted in
everything sensational and spectacular; in noise
and show and speed&mdash;what pleasure he would
have taken in locomotives and automobiles had
they existed in his day. It could not be said that
the laws were not respected or that the citizens,
as a body, were not at peace. But there were wild
extravagances and follies to startle and distress
the people. And that was not all. There were so
much dissipation and licentiousness in high places
that all the best people in the empire were scandalized
and it was evident that the moral strength
of the nation was undermined.</p>

<p>Nero was sowing to the wind and he was sure
to reap the whirlwind. Satirical voices began to
make themselves heard. Then Burrus, the strong
soldier and wise counselor, died; and Nero divided
his command between Fenius Rufus, a timid and
subservient man, and Tigellinus, one of his own
infamous associates.</p>

<p>The influence of Seneca, which in many respects
had tended to wisdom and moderation, was thus
undermined and broken. He had gained nothing by
his temporizing with evil, his policy of compromise
and mildness. Perhaps Nero himself had become
disgusted with him for saying one thing in his
philosophic maxims and pursuing the opposite
course in his practice. He no longer treated Seneca
with veneration. Chagrined and broken-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the latter withdrew to a less conspicuous life.
Rubellius Plautus and Sulla, two prominent men,
of whom Nero was jealous, were put to death by
the emperor’s order, and at the instigation of
Tigellinus. The assassinations were accomplished
by messengers sent from the imperial court to the
provinces where they lived. Nero pretended to
be delivered thus from two dangerous adversaries
and required the Senate to congratulate him. He
even declared to friends that he was now free to
celebrate his marriage with Poppæa, without fear
of any rival who might profit by the public commiseration
for his wife Octavia. This woman,
who was the daughter of Claudius and whose life
at court had been one of constant distress, was
ruthlessly condemned and seized, upon some arrogant
pretext, and her veins were opened with a
knife. Her head was severed from her body and
carried to her enemy, the cruel Poppæa. After
this all restraints of decency and self-respect were
thrown off and wild orgies went on in the imperial
palaces.</p>

<div id="ip_115" class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">POPPÆA</div></div>

<p>In the tenth year of Nero’s reign Rome was
swept by a terrible fire. It began at the eastern
end of the Circus Maximus, between the Palatine
and Cælian hills. It swept along the bases of the
Palatine and Aventine hills, through the Velabrum
on the one hand and the Forum on the other.
It raged six days, destroying both private dwellings
and public buildings. Many of the old cherished
landmarks of Rome, like the Regia (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
palace) of Numa, the Temple of Jupiter Stator,
and the Temple of Vesta, were ruined. When it
was thought to have subsided a renewal of it, or
another fire, broke out on the outskirts of the city
beneath the Pincian hill and raged toward the
Viminal and the Quirinal. Of the fourteen districts,
or regions of the city, three were entirely
obliterated, while seven others were more or less
severely injured. Not only noted buildings but
elegant patrician homes and many rare works of
art,&mdash;works that could not be duplicated,&mdash;were
altogether lost.</p>

<p>The poorer people, of course, were brought into
a condition of great hardship and suffering. The
conflagration occurred when the tyrannies and
cruelties of Nero had largely increased the number
of his personal enemies, when mutterings of
contempt and hatred against him had become frequent,
and when his iniquitous excesses had led
many to believe that he could be guilty of anything.
The fact that some incendiaries were seen
at work, who said they were acting under orders,
and the rumor that while the city was burning
Nero had watched the flames from the tower of
his villa, and had there chanted the “Sack of
Troy” with the accompaniment of his own lyre,
favored the suspicion that he had himself caused
the awful calamity. Some claimed that he did it
in order that he might rebuild the capital more
magnificently and call the new Rome by his own
name. But these suspicions cannot be proved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>It is enough to affirm that under the additional
miseries caused by the fire the people had become
bold to express their exasperation with the existing
reign. Not even the imposing religious ceremonies,
conducted to appease the gods, could quiet
the popular outcries. Nero seems to have felt
that it was necessary to divert suspicions from
himself by presenting other victims.</p>

<p>Tacitus tells us that to save himself, this emperor
sacrificed “those whom, hated on account
of their vices, the vulgar called Christians.” This
name, he says, was derived from one Christus,
who was executed in the reign of Tiberius by the
procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate. And he
adds that “the accursed superstition, for a moment
repressed, spread again, not over Judea
only, the source of this evil, but in Rome also,
where all things vile and shameful find room and
reception.” This Neronian persecution, so horrible
in its bitterness and bloodshed, we shall have
occasion to consider later in connection with the
sufferings of the early Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>We may remark here that some, such as the historian
Gibbon, have found a difficulty in accepting
the plain assertions of Tacitus and Suetonius on
this subject on the ground that there was nothing
in the known habits and teachings of the Christians
at this early period to call down upon them
such bitter hatred. They were peaceable citizens
and had hardly yet become distinct from the Jews
in the observation of the Romans. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
suggested that Tacitus and others, writing some
time after the event, were describing what was
really a persecution of the Jews in Rome and
that, because they had incurred the displeasure of
Nero by their turbulent disputes over an expected
Christ or over certain false Christs and because,
in Tacitus’ time, the Christians proclaimed the
Christ as having come, the historian had not kept
these facts distinct and was attributing to the
Christians an unpopularity which, so early, belonged
to them only as part of the Jews. Merivale
suggests that there may be an element of
truth in this theory. That is to say, the Jews,
when persecuted for their Messianic enthusiasm,
may have succeeded in transferring the odium to
the Christians as being in this respect far more
intense than themselves.</p>

<p>That Nero did subject the believers of Jesus to
great cruelty and that Paul, if not Peter, suffered
martyrdom during his reign have been accepted
beliefs from such early times and are so consistent
with the otherwise well-known caprice and
severity of Nero that there seems no reason to
doubt the facts. The Neronian persecution may
have been short and limited to Italy, but it was
sharp and bloody. The reckless tyranny of Nero
was supported by the voluptuousness and heartlessness
of his age. The statements of the Apostle
Paul in the first chapter of his Epistle to the
Romans are not too strong concerning the gross
immorality of society. Stoicism promulgated, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
some noble ideals and may even have been
stimulated to do its best by the challenges of
Christianity, but the body politic was corrupt
throughout.</p>

<p>After the great fire Nero addressed himself
with zeal to the rebuilding of Rome. He had a
pride in making his capital splendid and especially
in erecting for himself his famous palace
called “the Golden House.” This seems to have
been a connection and combination, by means of
arches and porticos, of the palaces on the Palatine
with others on the Esquiline. In these buildings,
which required several acres, he followed
the Greek models of architecture and ornament.
A conspicuous feature among them was his own
colossal statue set up near what is now called,
from it, the Colosseum. To defray the expense of
these and other buildings he exacted or confiscated
the wealth of other men and even stole with
impious cupidity some of the rich gifts which had
been placed in the temples. The growing discontent
and opposition to him, therefore, became
more manifest among the nobility. Conspiracies
were formed against him. Some of these he was
able to put down; but others sprang up in their
places. Sometimes, alarmed by them, he drowned
his fears in a flood of popular flattery gained by
his undignified performances in the circus and the
theater both at home and abroad. When his wife
Poppæa died, some asserted that it was a consequence
of his own brutal treatment. One great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
man after another, some of them honored by historians
as almost personifications of virtue, lost
their lives by poison or by the sword, by assassination
or by compelled suicide, as victims to his
jealousy or his covetousness.</p>

<p>Even Seneca, the philosophic instructor of
Nero’s youth, had fallen under his imperial
pupil’s displeasure. Nero had no use for Seneca’s
moral precepts and felt that he was no longer
helpful to him in the affairs of State. They were
also sharers in too many guilty secrets for Nero
to care for his presence. An attempt was made to
involve him in a charge of treason brought, with
truth, against Calpurnius and others. This
charge was not proved against Seneca, but it was
made the most of at court. Not long after this
the Prefect Burrus died, and his successor, Tigellinus,
was no friend of Seneca. He inflamed the
emperor’s covetousness for Seneca’s enormous
wealth, which then, he said, was throwing into the
shade the splendor of the imperial household. He
also represented Seneca as a rival to him in poetry
and eloquence. All these arguments prevailed
with a heart already full of hatred.</p>

<p>So an order was sent to Seneca that he must
die. It was received without alarm. As time was
refused him wherein to remake his will, he said
to the friends around him that he would bequeath
to them the example of his life. He checked their
tears and asked them where were their precepts of
philosophy and the fortitude that their studies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
should have taught them? Did they not know the
cruelty of Nero? Was it not to be expected that
he would make an end of his master and tutor
after murdering his mother and his brother? He
begged his wife Paulina not to enter upon an endless
sorrow. The veins of his limbs were then
opened that he might bleed to death, a process
that had to be accelerated by a vapor bath. During
his lingering distress he conversed with those
attending him. When Seneca passed away, Nero,
though feeling a grim satisfaction, had really lost
the best counselor he ever had.</p>

<div id="ip_121" class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;"><img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="434" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">SENECA</div></div>

<p>In many of his writings, this great philosopher
rose to a lofty height of ethical insight and discrimination.
He seems to have been truly anxious
to raise the moral tone of society. No man up to
his time had apprehended more clearly than did
he that moral light with which God is ready to
light every man that cometh into the world. No
man wrote better of sincerity, courage, contentment,
justice, kindness to others even to the weakest
slave, mercy to the wicked, the beauty of unselfishness,
and the mind’s possible superiority
to its environment. He was a great expounder of
natural religion as studied by his observation and
by his conscience. Here, for example are a few
of his maxims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If we wish to be just judges of all things, let us first persuade
ourselves of this: that there is not one of us without fault.</p>

<p>We shall be wise if we desire but little.</p>

<p>If each man takes account of himself and measures his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
body he will know how little it can contain and for how short
a time.</p>

<p>Man is born for mutual assistance. You must live for another
if you wish to live for yourself.</p>

<p>We are members of one great body.&mdash;Let him who hath conferred
a favor hold his tongue about it.</p>

<p>Man’s best gifts lie beyond the power of man either to give
or to take away. The Universe, the grandest and loveliest work
of nature, and the intellect, which was created to observe and
admire, are our special and eternal possessions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such examples might be culled in great numbers
from his writings. He seems at times to have
been an earnest seeker after God. He declared
that God did not dwell in temples made of wood
and stone; that He did not delight in the blood of
victims; that He is near to all His creatures; that
men must believe in Him before they can approach
Him, and that the truest service for Him is to be
like unto Him. Some of his sayings approach the
lofty precepts of Christ and His apostles. He is
frequently quoted with approbation by early
Christian writers. Yet his precepts differ from
the Scriptural teachings in the fact that some of
them are merely rhetorical and superficial.
Others are fragmentary and inadequate. They
are not winnowed from all chaff. At their highest
level also they simply emphasize the demands of
the moral law without offering to man any help
for attaining to holiness other than what his own
heroic decision may furnish. In their searching
quality some of them are of a type so Pauline
that many have thought that he and Paul, his contemporary,
must have been well acquainted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
There is said to have been a tradition to that
effect as early as the fourth century. Indeed,
some early Christian thought he was doing a good
service to write a book that he called “Conversations
between Seneca and Paul.” Its spuriousness
is now generally admitted. But we naturally
ask: Is it likely that Seneca knew anything of
Paul?</p>

<p>On one hand, we may answer on general principles
that a man in the high position of Seneca
would not be likely to come into contact with despised
and persecuted people, such as the Jews
(and especially the Christians) then were. Most
stoics would rather repel such company superciliously.
On the other hand, we know that Paul
had been tried in Corinth by Marcus Annæus
Gallio, Seneca’s brother, and that at Paul’s arrival
at Rome he was put under the charge of
Burrus, the prefect of the Prætorian Guard, who
was Seneca’s friend. It is possible that through
one of these, especially the latter, the philosopher
may have heard of the apostle and in the course
of his philosophic inquiries may have gone to hear
him in disguise or listened to reports of his
preaching, which was causing a stir among the
Jews. He may thus have used ideas the source of
which he would not deign to acknowledge.
Whether this was true or not, it is probable that
Paul and Peter were before long much respected
by some members of the Annæan family to which
Seneca belonged. Lanciani tells us that in 1867<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
an inscription was found in a tomb at Ostia such
as is here reproduced.</p>

<p>While it is clearly a pagan inscription, shown
by the invocation letters D . M (Diis Manibus,&mdash;to
the gods of the lower regions,&mdash;) Marcus
Annæus, the father, who placed the inscription,
seems to have been named for Paul, and the
Marcus Annæus, the “dearest son,” whom it
commemorates, to have been named for both Paul
and Peter. The occurrence of the two names together</p>

<p class="center bbox">
D . M<br />
M. ANNÆO<br />
PAULO . PETRO<br />
M. ANNÆUS . PAULUS<br />
FILIO . CARISSIMO
</p>

<p class="in0">make it altogether probable that both these
apostles had been held in great honor by this
particular household, and that a suggestion of a
friendship with Christians is not wholly
arbitrary.</p>

<p>Seneca was one of the greatest of the Stoics.
“The Stoical philosophy,” says Frederick Farrar,
“may be compared to a torch, which flings a faint
gleam here and there in the dusky recesses of a
mighty cavern, while Christianity may be compared
to the sun, pouring into the inmost depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of the same cavern its sevenfold illumination.
The torch had a value and a brightness of its own;
but, compared to the dawning of that new glory,
it appears to be dim and ineffectual, even though
its brightness was a real brightness and had been
drawn from the same ethereal source.” Concerning
the close of life, Seneca wrote to
Lucilius:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am preparing myself for that day on which, laying aside
all artifice or subterfuge, I shall be able to judge respecting
myself whether I really speak or merely feel as a brave man
should: whether all these words of haughty obstinacy which I
have hurled against fortune were mere pretense and pantomime.
What you have really achieved will then be manifest when your
end is near.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alas! the trouble with Seneca was that which
puts all the great moral philosophers so far below
Christ and even his apostles, namely, that he
so failed to live up to the precepts that he wrote.
It was when he descended from the plane of theory
and sentiment to that of practice in daily life that
he often ignobly failed.</p>

<p>No complete biography of him has come down
to us. The curtain rises and falls over separated
scenes in his life. But we know enough to mark
his strange inconsistencies. His temporizing
management of his imperial pupil, his accumulation
of great wealth while he was extolling poverty,
his mingling among the extravagancies and
corruptions of the imperial court, his apparent
failure to express any condemnation of the murders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of Britannicus and Agrippina, and his apology
for the latter of these horrors, which he wrote
for Nero, are enough to be mentioned. It must be
admitted that he had a very hard place to fill as an
adviser of the emperor, and was often, doubtless,
sorely perplexed to know what course of action
would be best for the public welfare, but he cannot
be acquitted of consent to some of Nero’s
crimes.</p>

<p>It was from the Roman army at last that retribution
came to the cruel tyrant. He had become
uneasy at the murmurs and the gloom that had
manifestly increased among the people at his capital.
He went for relief to his rural resorts in
Campania. Reports of discontent there came to
him from the provinces. The army camps contained
many who were brooding over wrongs he
had done them and were waiting for their revenge.</p>

<p>Among the prominent military men of the day
was Servius Sulpicius Galba, who had for some
years ruled under the imperial government over a
portion of Spain. Descended from an honored
family, this man had also achieved for himself
renown and was popular with the soldiers. He
was, therefore, an object of jealousy to Nero,
though he was seventy-three years of age. While
Nero was absent from Italy, making exhibitions
of himself in public theaters and circuses, in
Greece, Galba received some overtures from
Caius Julius Vindex, a Roman general in Gaul,
who hated Nero for some of his exactions. Vindex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
felt that there was no chance for himself to be the
successor of Nero, but he fixed his eyes on Galba
as a possible chief. Galba hesitated to lead a
revolution. Meanwhile the plottings of Vindex
were discovered and that officer committed suicide.</p>

<p>Galba then felt that he must be more than ever
an object of hatred to Nero’s cruelty, and that he
might as well proceed in an attempt to restore
prosperity to the empire. He harangued the
soldiers. They saluted him as emperor, but he
would not as yet receive any title but that of
Legate of the Senate and Roman people. He, however,
enlisted more young men and prepared for
a campaign. When the Roman general, Virginius
Rufus of lower Germany, entered into communication
with him, the news spread far and wide that
Nero’s fall was sure. Otho, Nero’s former companion,
from his distant station on the shore of
the Atlantic, sent messages of cheer to Galba.
Roman legions in other parts of the world also
respectively hailed their own chiefs as emperor.
The empire seemed to be breaking up into pieces.</p>

<p>When Nero’s attention was first called to the
handwriting on the wall, as it were, he treated it
with contempt and expressed satisfaction at the
prospect of confiscating to his own uses the estates
of these traitors. He lingered for a while, ridiculously
seeking applause for himself by his participation
in public entertainments at Naples. After
he returned to Rome he dedicated a temple to
Poppæa. But he spent much time in trifles, playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and singing and driving the chariot in the
circus. When courier after courier dashed into
Rome bringing tidings of the rebellion of this or
that province, he summoned troops from Illyricum
and brought sailors from the fleet at Ostia to defend
the city. He threatened to recall the foreign
magistrates and disgrace them. He called upon
the populace, whom he had pampered, to rise in
his behalf or he would let loose his lions upon
them. He declared he would massacre those
Senators who would not stand by him. Finally,
he said he would meet the approaching revolutionists
unarmed, trusting to his beauty, his tears,
and his persuasive voice. Meanwhile the truly
patriotic were happy in the increasing expectation
of some deliverance from his yoke.</p>

<p>He had reached Rome in February. By June
his cause was hopeless. Galba, it is true, with his
forces, had not arrived. But the Prætorian Guard
had been turned against him by their prefect,
Nymphidius, to whom the camp had been given up
by Tigellinus. When told that his last hope of assistance
had deceived him, Nero started up from
his couch at supper in his Golden House, dashed
his choicest cups, which he had been using, to the
ground, borrowed a vial of poison and went out
to walk restlessly in the neighboring gardens.
Afterward he conjured some of the military
officers to join him in flight. They all either found
excuses or openly refused. Then one, bolder than
the rest, said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it then so hard to die?”</p>

<p>He would have gone and thrown himself into the
Tiber. One of his freedmen, named Phaon,
offered his villa as a refuge. It was about four
miles from Rome. It is easily identified still,
situated between the Via Salaria and the Via
Nomentana. For this he started, wearing a rough
dress and barefoot and with a mantle of coarse
material about his shoulders and face. In this
disguise he was mounted on a horse and was accompanied
by four friends, Phaon, Epaphroditus
(who was another wealthy freedman, the secretary
or librarian of Nero), Sporus, and one more
whose name is not given. He passed through the
city gate at early dawn, not far from the Prætorian
camp. Some accounts declare that he
could hear soldiers cursing his name and declaring
that Galba would be his successor. It is said
that thunder and lightning and the shock of earthquake
added to the excitement of the hour, while
the sky was draped with heavy black clouds.
They met some people hurrying into the city. One
asked what news there might be from the palace.</p>

<div id="ip_129" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="600" height="431" alt="" /><div class="caption">NOMENTANA BRIDGE</div></div>

<p>Before crossing the Nomentana bridge, over the
Anio, a bridge that is still standing, Nero’s horse
shied, frightened at a dead man lying by the roadside.
This caused the emperor’s disguise to slip
aside for a moment, so that a messenger from the
Prætorian camp, passing just then, recognized his
face. Near the fourth milestone they turned
aside and followed a path through a canebrake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
along the edge of a ditch, now called the Fosso
della Cecchina. This brought them to the rear of
Phaon’s villa, for they had not approached the
main entrance that they might escape observation.
A hole had to be made in the back wall of the
house. When it was completed, they crept through
it into a bath-room, where Nero threw himself
upon a pallet. His comrades urged him at once
to escape by suicide from the indignities which
would be heaped upon him by his foes as soon as
he was captured. Presently word was brought to
him that the Senate had decreed his death as an
enemy to Rome. Terrified at this Nero took two
daggers from his bosom, and with many grimaces
tried their edges, one after another, and then laid
them down, saying that the moment for him to
use them had not yet come. Then he implored
some one to set him the example of suicide. He
reproached himself for his timidity.</p>

<p>“Fie, fie, Nero!” he cried, “Courage, man;
come!”</p>

<p>Hearing then the sound of horsemen sent to
seize him alive, he placed a weapon to his throat
and his freedman Epaphroditus drove it home.
This was on the ninth of June, in the 14th year
of his reign and when he was at the age of thirty
years and six months.</p>

<p>He was the last of the Julian family. Though
few were disposed to weep at his departure and
though multitudes throughout the empire felt
relief when they heard of it, his body was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
refused a decent burial. By the consent of Icelus,
representing Galba, the newly elected emperor,
Ecloge and Alexandra, who had been the nurses
of his childhood, with Acte, who had been a companion
in his vices, and the three men who had
accompanied him in his flight furnished the money
for the cremation of his body, with suitable
ceremonies.</p>

<p>The three women brought the ashes and placed
them in the tomb of the Domitian family. This
stood on a spur of the Pincian Hill, not far behind
the present church of Santa Maria del Popolo,
just inside the city gate and in the square of the
same name. Lanciani speaks of the discovery (in
a very recent year, on the exact spot of Nero’s
suicide) of the tomb of Claudia Ecloge, the old
nurse who had been so devoted to the emperor
when a child. The fields around the spot for
hundreds of feet in every direction are said to
have been strewn with the usual ruins of a villa
of the first century and the finding of this simple
slab is a most pathetic incident, in view of the
details that we have described. Lord Byron says
in “Don Juan”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Nero perished by the justest doom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which ever the destroyer yet destroyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of nations freed and the world overjoyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hands unseen strewed flowers upon his tomb,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of feeling for some kindness done, when power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>
<p>The stone slab on which is inscribed the simple
epitaph of Ecloge is in the Capitoline Museum.
Perhaps it was by her own request, in tender
recollections of earlier days and also of her part
in the preparations of his body for its cremation,
that she was buried on the scene of her infamous
nurseling’s death.</p>

<p>There is an old tradition that the Church of
Santa Maria del Popolo was founded by Pope
Pascal II in the early part of the eleventh century
on the site of the tombs of the Domitii and the
burial place of Nero, because he would thus free
the place from the demons that were supposed to
haunt it. In the sixteenth century it was the Augustinian
Convent (now suppressed) adjoining
this church that was the lodging place of the monk
Martin Luther on his visit to Rome. On his arrival
he prostrated himself on the earth and exclaimed
in the language of an old pilgrim hymn:</p>

<p>“I salute thee, O holy Rome, sacred with the
blood of the martyrs.”</p>

<p>Then he celebrated mass in the church. Before
he departed from Rome,&mdash;having very different
feelings from those with which he had entered it,
and soon to become a great reformer,&mdash;he celebrated
mass in this church again. It contains
many grand old tombs and fine works of art. In
the center of the square, between four spouting
lions, rises the Egyptian obelisk, which the Emperor
Augustus erected in B.&nbsp;C. 10, in the ancient
Circus Maximus to commemorate the subjugation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of Egypt. Its hieroglyphic inscription is said to
mention the names of Meneptah and Rameses III
(1326 and 1273 B.&nbsp;C.).</p>

<p>Hawthorne in his “Marble Faun,” that book
which has become a very classic for its reproduction
of modern Roman life and spirit, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All Roman works and ruins, whether of the empire, the far-off
Republic or the still more distant Kings, assume a transient, visionary
and impalpable character when we think that this indestructible
monument supplied one of the recollections which
Moses and the Israelites bore from Egypt into the desert. Perchance
on beholding the cloudy pillar and the fiery column
they whispered awe-stricken to one another: “In its shape it is
like that old obelisk which we and our fathers have so often seen
on the borders of the Nile.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And now that very obelisk, with hardly a trace
of decay upon it, is the first thing that the modern
traveler sees after entering the Flaminian gate.
Egyptian monarchs, Roman emperors, the leader
of the Protestant Reformation:&mdash;what widely
different historic names are conjured up for us by
these adjacent memorials. Near the church the
carriage driveway now leads up from terrace to
terrace to the public garden on the Pincian Hill.
Here the modern landscape artists have laid out
a charming resort, reminding us of the ancient
and luxurious gardens of Lucullus which stood
near the same spot. Until 1840 this beautiful
park had been for centuries a desolate waste;
and here in the middle ages the ghost of Nero was
believed to be forever wandering. On pleasant
afternoons, and especially on Sunday afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
many fine equipages may now be seen moving
along its avenues, for it is the fashionable promenade
of the Roman aristocracy, and from it a fine
view over the city, taking in the dome of Saint
Peter’s, may be enjoyed. The military band discourses
excellent music. The occupants of the
carriages greet each other with bows and smiles.
Pedestrians loiter and converse. In this strange
old city, including so many strata of memories and
so cosmopolitan in its society, modern gayeties and
venerable antiquities jostle one another. In the
midst of the living and festive throng one’s mind
can rove back through history and think of this
and that famous event, significant or tragic and
widely separated in time, which have occurred
upon the ground over which he is passing.</p>

<h2><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT"></a>POSTSCRIPT</h2>


<p>In these brief reviews, which we have now made
of the careers of the five great Cæsars of the
New Testament period, we have caught many impressions
of the dark character of that world into
which Christ came and in which His kingdom had
to make its first spiritual conquests. It was an
age of vast wealth and power, but these were concentrated
in the hands of a few. Enormous sums
were spent on ostentatious displays, on epicurean
feasts, and on sumptuous couches. The great
masses of men were poor and ignorant indeed.
Selfish luxury and extravagance mocked at abject
beggary and despair. Multitudes were always on
the verge of starvation. Little children were frequently
exposed to die. It was an age of cynical
unbelief as to the great verities of God and the
soul, and at the same time one of trifling and
absurd superstition. Philosophical groping after
truth was accompanied by deep sadness. Dissipation
found its penalty in cloyed disgust. Suicide
was not only frequent but approved by some of
the great teachers. Cold cruelty was the minister
to unbridled ambition. It was a time of sanguinary
combats in the arena and of widespread
slavery. The old Roman virtues of the stern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
faithful type had largely expired. Never was
there an age in which all forms of vice displayed
more openly their methods and their achievements.
As men became more polished in artistic
culture they seemed to become more vile in personal
conduct. The poet Horace said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The age of our fathers, worse than that of our grandsires, has
produced us, who are yet baser and who are doomed to give birth
to a still more degraded offspring.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seneca wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All things are full of iniquity and vice; more crime is committed
than can be remedied by restraint. We struggle in a huge
contest of criminality. Daily the passion for sin is greater. The
shame in committing it is less.</p></blockquote>

<p>From these quotations, and many others that
might be collected, we see that society in Rome at
that time presented a picture at once repellent
and most pathetic. It had developed enormous
moral and spiritual needs, which no human
wisdom nor power could satisfy. It was weary
and heavy laden, and was sighing for rest. Yet
the day was at hand.</p>

<p>The Light of the World had come.</p>
